t3_m4oh6p,I don't regret playing Dota,"There have been a lot of posts on here about toxicity in the Dota community making it seem like it is some kind of unique hellscape that is not present in other online games. In my experience there are vastly more good games and average games than bad. I play in 3.5-4k mmr range at 10k behavior score. I see people encouraging each other when something is not going well and try to address issues as they come up. Nobody gives up until the game is truly over. Now after the game there is often a discussion or an argument in the post-game lobby but it  has no effect on gameplay.

In general I would say that playing Dota has been a net benefit in my life. I wouldn't put this on any resume but I definitely have ranked matchmaking to thank for a lot of applicable skills. I learned working in a team under pressure, handling personal mistakes, dealing with problem teammates, and overall mental strength. I feel like I am above average in workplace conflict resolution and at giving/receiving instructions.

I also want to add the following perspective as an average player and a frequent reader of this subreddit. These are just my opinions in an ordered list. 

1. Smurfs are NOT that common - people can sometimes have good games. Snowball effect of certain heroes exaggerates their success and impact on the game. 
2. Toxic teammates do happen but they are quite rare and they can be worked with. People getting emotional about the game can often be correct and make decent calls. As a good teammate you can help them not tilt. Worst-case scenario, there is always a mute button.
3. There is no chance that new players can handle even low mmr gameplay and I have no idea what to do about it.",DotA2

t3_m49gfs,How I got an unintentional abandon,"Tonight I got on to play a few games of Dota with my mates for a couple of 5 stack ranked games, as we have been in the habit of doing. We have a fairly big MMR disparity in our party so sometimes our games are not very balanced and we tend to get one-sided games a fair portion of the time.

In this game I had the most unenjoyable game of Dota 2 I have ever played. After being thoroughly rinsed in all lanes, the enemy team made the decision to not take any barracks, so that they could begin fountain farming us. Utilising shadow poison to get vision of us in the fountain their mid lion would repeatedly one shot us with finger. The earthshaker would deny creeps repeatedly to create a mega wave that would help take their own barracks to prolong the game. Several members of our team elected to buy shadow amulets and run into the jungle to hide and dissuade the enemies from prolonging the game, but it had no effect.

This situation is what caused me to get my first abandon in Dota. I was playing rubick, and after the fountain farming began I could not escape the base. Because I was afk in the fountain from dying instantly after spawning I could not gain any xp. After 5 minutes of not gaining xp you get an auto abandon for inactivity. 

This caused me to leave the game out of frustration and then another one of my teammates left and 4 of their team left. Leaving the game as a 1v3, and my friends managed to bring the game back and actually ended up killing the enemy ancient. At the end the last man standing said his team promised him that they would boost him.

t3_m42qrq,Dota 2 Mentorship Program Announcement: Mentor Applications Open!,"With the upcoming release of the Dota 2 anime, the teams at r/compDota2 and DotaFromZero have partnered to create the Dota 2 Mentorship Program. Dota is an exceptionally difficult game, and while there are resources like DotaFromZero, Slack's Tutorial, and Purge's guides, we still feel that there is a notable gap in the new player experience. This program exists to fill that gap.

**What do we do?**

This program is all about pairing a mentee and a mentor together for a 13 week ""cycle"" where the mentor will help the mentee grow as a player and be more than just a 'coach'. Coaching is great but often there is no personal or emotional commitment from either the coach or coachee. For example, a coach might point out issues that need fixing, never see that player again, and only care about the coachee so far as their obligation to spend X number of hours with them. On the other hand, a mentor will stick with the player and take personal interest in their growth: possibly becoming friends, playing with each other, and creating a lasting bond. This is a type of arrangement that has worked wonders in other contexts, and we figured it could also work in Dota.

**How do I join?**

Right now we have opened our applications for the next 10 days for ***mentors*** to apply. The application is somewhat detailed, as we do vet our mentors relatively rigorously, and the skillset we are looking for in a mentor is slightly different than what we would look for in a coach: Specifically, we want to see how well you can explain and break down fundamental Dota concepts more than just knowing about them.

The mentor application process looks like this:

1. Fill out the [mentor application](https://forms.gle/n77JqnswyTQUKvg3A) form.
2. Wait for approval from the organizers, and answer any questions they may have.

If you've been approved, you will:

1. Wait for mentee applications.
2. Select mentees from their applications to be your mentee for the 13 week cycle.

For ***mentees***, applications will open on April 1st (after we have vetted the mentor applicants) and remain open for 10 days. The mentee application process will look like this:

1. Look on the [mentor listing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n9zynvqv8Y0UCX_OTetnRCUSUSjCrBTNFGX0-ND7DwY/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet and find 1-2 mentors that you think would suit you well.
2. Apply through the [mentee application](https://forms.gle/FTwZ6JE7wfRJ3Rj17) form.
3. (optional) Direct message any mentors you have applied for if they indicated on the mentor listing that they are open to those kind of DMs.

Brand new players will be prioritized for this first cycle in light of the influx that (hopefully) we will see as a result of the anime release, though all players are encouraged to apply!

\---

Regardless, join [our discord](https://discord.gg/NmD4hG2xZm) whether you want to be a mentor, mentee, or just hang our as a guest. You can even apply as both a mentor and mentee (though if you become a mentor you won't be able to become a mentee again).

You can find more information about the program (rules, dates, etc) on the [**Cycle Information Document**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3ow9pp2LElJ9LTY6YRYOyJ9FB4MPrI_UZXVJccTUc0/edit). I **strongly recommend** those interested in the program check it out!",DotA2
t3_m4m9z8,Overreacting to fountain farming,"For some reason people are complaining a lot about fountain farming.

Ya its not very nice, but some of the more inane comments are asking for invulnerability in the fountain

I wonder why an earthshaker or magnus shouldn't have a free aeon disk that lets them do damage.... or when a team is trying to close a game, let's have mk ulti, nether ward etc etc do no damage, what could go wrong....

Personally when I'm losing a game, I really want them to start fountain farming because then I can possibly turn it around.

And if it's that hopeless, I just alt-tab and do something else. 

Aside from all that, diving the fountain is FUN. 
There is a thrill. I suppose by the time you have bought a smoke to do it it's not fun(because now it's calculated), but when you just dive in it's great. 

It's annoying when people start policing others fun just because some people take it to extremes.",DotA2

t3_m4qvg3,Why can't I enjoy a casual unranked game in SEA with my friends?,"Guys, look, almost every game I play in SEA is a SO toxic. They are so quiet when they're losing, but when they make the slightest comeback, they start pausing, and trashtalking. I just do not understand this. I've played with All chat off pretty much most my games in SEA, but this one game I played with my All chat on.

So apparently, this game they got mad just because I used the Dota + Lycan voice line ""Ha, that was a mauling"" after making a clutch TP (with 1 hp) - this happened at around 17 mins into the game. Then they trashtalked the fuck out of me because of THAT at like 48 mins.

Man honestly, I wonder if all players in SEA are freaking kids who can't enjoy a normal game without trashtalking. Please fix your attitude towards this game, and don't get mad when someone uses a feature in the fucking game. Thank you, rant over.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. For anyone wondering I play my solo games in Australia, but I have to play SEA to play with my friends because they live in South Asian countries (India isn't an option, and neither is Japan - SEA is the only middle ground).

t3_m4hgzu,Meepo needs to be buffed.,"Everything that made this hero good is just gone, 

- you can't use BOT for global presence
- 30% XP for clones has killed the pace of this hero
- lvl 4 - 11 - 17 for the ult takes too long to get and now he has very little early game impact.
- He fits in maybe once every 100 games since so many heroes got some kind of AOE skills and so many other mids are just a better option.
- you gotta pray really hard for the right neutral items since he only shares stats and they can only be picked up by the main Meepo.
- The new ahgs is ... useless. it's cool in concept but it's just never worth it.
- Base agility and Gain are very low.


Something needs to be changed because this hero is just been pretty bad since 7.20 and he is just the most situational hero in the game, as I see it there are 3 options.

- Update Meepo to be played in a completely new way (there is a good Henry video about offlane Meepo, where you build pipe and such while the enemy team just tries to counter you and make space for you carry), the last time I saw anything interesting on this hero was when Abed was going 2 Dragon lance build. 

- Ahgs needs to be a complete game changer, right now Dig is just a useless skill and I would always go for Skadi or another Eblade instead of Ahgs.

- Just revert the existing changes.

t3_m4h4qs,"The fact that this new ""confirm match"" cheat that lets you scout before even clicking accept has any success at improving winrate at all is proof that matchmaking deliberately doesnt create even games a huge percentage of the time.","Matchmaking is supposed to make completely even games for both teams. Now, when you get to the tippy top brackets there are less players, so of course the teams arent going to be exactly even because less people are queuing up at any given time.

But if matchmaking was doing its job, this cheat would be literally useless. There would be literally no value in scouting players before hitting the accept button if matchmaking creates even games enough of the time.

If this cheat makes rises in winrate any larger than like 3% just means the algorithm either intentionally does this or needs a huge overhaul. The fact that match quality is so fucking terrible (Griefers and player behavior aside) to even call for the creation of such a cheat should be a gigantic signal in the ability to play an actual fair game of dota 2.

This isn't up for debate really, the fact that a cheat now exists that improves your winrate beause you can clearly see unfair games before they happen means that your chances of winning a game are basically sealed before the game starts.

If the matchmaking quality didnt scew games before they start there would be no reason to create this cheat.

I've  tried looking for people to play with several times, but so far haven't really found a consistent bunch of players. 

I like planning for a strategy before hand, like deciding heroes that go well together, or practicing certain duos. Of course you also need to take into account that sometimes some heroes are banned, and that sometimes opponents have heroes which warrant different picks. I like thinking about builds and item orders, although DOTA doesn't really afford a lot of room for experimentation, you can still have some fun trying out new things occasionally.

I'd prefer playing with a bit higher rated players, especially since I'm like at the bottom of the rating barrel so it's hard to find lower rated players anyway.

Disclaimer:

I also got into trouble with the Russian security services back in 2016, long before I started playing this game, and have received some harassment online. That means commenters might be related to this trolling case. It's also annoying when I get friend invites and they turn out to be from these Russia trolls. 

The word ""Russia troll"" in this case does not refer to a person that's necessarily ethnically Russian. But that's what I'm using for a lack of a better word. My assumption is that these people are some kind of low level foreign recruits for the Russian security services, but it's not clear if the people involved themselves know for certain that it goes all the way back to Russia. Personally I wouldn't want to talk about this, but since I continually receive subtle harassment related to this, I have to kind of try and deter trolls by mentioning in advance, that I have contacted the authorities, including the local counter-intelligence. So if you're a troll with the intent of writing something nasty or sending me a friend invite with the purpose of messing with me later, then perhaps you're less motivated to do that knowing that the counter-intelligence has been notified. Additionally, for the rest of you who have nothing to do with this, at least I let you know in advance, in case you're worried that you could get involved into a mess you don't want to be in, then you can just ignore this ad for playmates. 

A short word about the methodology involved. The Russian harassment methodology in this case is fairly subtle, and it's designed to make it difficult for local law enforcement to intervene. A lot of it involves this long term over time conditioning, basically keeping track and creating reference points about a person, whom you know that the person will respond to, but will be meaningless to outsiders and bystanders. For an example if something important happens to you in your life, such that there's a thing that suddenly gets a special meaning for you, it can be used in this harassment procedure. Personally I'd rather spend my time thinking about other things and just play some DOTA, but apparently that's not something they're welcoming in this case, so we'll just have to see how things proceed.",DotA2

I've been aware of the abuse myself and so are MANY other highmmr players but someone should let Valve know so they could fix the abuse as there are A LOT of bought accounts at high MMR bracket. I am 100% sure I'll be blamed &amp; receive threats from a bunch of people who abuse this and make tons of money but someone should make the move already.**



Basically, you used to get 6000 MMR tops after your recalibration half a year ago. Now after a certain update Valve added the brand new ""recalibrate"" button and the maximum MMR you could get is now infinite but you need to do a few things to make it work. After a few steps a 2-4k account becomes 6.5k MMR minimum, 4-6k account becomes 8k (7k minimum), a 7k account becomes 8-10k+ (8k minimum). All you need to have is 1 high MMR account (9-10k MMR) and/or cache manipulations.


I can't write steps how to reproduce here as posts will be removed so I sent them to GabeN. I'm ready to provide needed information &amp; proofs to Valve if this post gets enough attention as I doubt Gabe will read it.  Example of such [an account #1](https://imgur.com/aGQ7bRW), [example #2](https://imgur.com/j7LZW7H). Their main accounts are 5-5.5k MMR and here are the 9k average games.

t3_m3myi9,Dota 2 Theory: Artifact's Rix is Fenrir (Dog-Beast Hero),"Artifact is dead, and as polarizing as it was while it was alive, in death it's serving as a gold mine of character and story potential for Valve to use in Dota. Multiple pieces of artwork, lore, and locations have been shown and could still be explored. Multiple interesting heroes who could have huge impact on Dota are there for use, including the topic of this post Rix. We've had a lot of hints recently, as well some code leaks that point to Fenrir being one of if not the next hero added, and in this thread I've compiled enough evidence to prove who this hero is and what he may look like.

https://preview.redd.it/2yhlxnlmsmm61.png?width=526&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81eeed9a1c10eb0b77cdcaf66863e92955b7810a

&amp;#x200B;

Rix is a Voul warrior who was conscripted into the bronze legion at a very young age. He served under Tresdin (Legion Commander) and helped win countless battles during the legions several year long campaigns. He was loyal, until Tresdin anticipated the Red Mist Horde would stike Stonehall through the town of Roseleaf. Tresdin traveled to Stonehall to get support in fortifying the town and sent Rix and her second in command Marcus. Roseleaf was a village of Voul, and Tresdin believed Rix would smooth relations between these Voul and her forces while they occupied the city. Unfortunately, the Legions cruel treatment of the Voul pushed Rix's loyalty to the breaking point, and he formed and lead a rebellion and killed Marcus. The rebellion fought the Legion while the Red mist attacked causing the legion to ultimately fail to defend Roseleaf.

Rix's rebellion ultimately failed, and unfortunately this defeat was made worse by the fact that Rix had done the one thing you never want to do in Dota, make a deal with a demon, but not just any deal, and certainly not just any demon, Rix took the Oath from Shadow Fiend.

https://preview.redd.it/masugd03tmm61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8703c2db1decec65c8c25de5412dee25b8924ef

The Oath is an ancient seal, it gives whomever takes it great power and control over undead, in exchange they will become a servant of the demon who gave them said Oath. Rix took the Oath knowing that facing the Legion and Red Mist with just a ragtag group of villagers, but he could not anticipate the pure chaos of the battle as it attracted the Keen's newly formed army, vile heroes like Necrophos and Venomancer, the blood lusting Bloodseeker, and Zues and Storm spirit having an electric dick measuring contest.

Rix was defeated, his forces lay dead, but the Oath cannot be escaped, not even in death. The dead Voul began to rise, and Rix's time to keep his side of the Oath had come.

https://preview.redd.it/auwffeg5tmm61.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54737d0f6e364687e16e7d9e6831671522f2270b

This is the end of Rix's cannon story, and we have another expansion of Artifact that's lore was mostly unexplored, but by using unused voice lines, parallels of Norse Mythology, and a dash of headcannon, I believe I can prove Rix is the unreleased Beast hero.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start with unused voice lines, Mars was the first to address our unreleased beast hero. All lines can be found on the wiki under responses.  [Mars/Responses - Dota 2 Wiki (gamepedia.com)](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Mars/Responses)

He has 2 lines when meeting the Beast hero that give great insight on this how the Beast hero differs from other animalistic and furry heroes in dota.

""*Do you understand language, beastie?*"" is our first and is already a fantastic start. The beast hero clearly can't speak, just like Oath bound Rix who is permanently silenced both as a game mechanic and do to the Oath. This also adds a layer of irony to regular Rix's signature card that is a silence and his voice line about not being silenced by the Legion.

""*You can chew on whatever I leave in my wake*!"" is our second line and shows that not only can he not speak, but is also likely savage and unwieldy. Mars' lines when killing the beast hero are just barks and howls further proving that Rix might not even be Rix anymore. As shown in the card art, he might be becoming something else entirely.

Snapfire is next with only 2 lines both not being super relevant. [Snapfire/Responses - Dota 2 Wiki (gamepedia.com)](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Snapfire/Responses)

""*Got no use for a varmint what can't be trained*!"" is our first line and is a kill line. Already hitting home that the Beast hero is wild and uncontrollable.

""*I suppose you and Mortimer can play together*."" is our ally meet line and is a bit weird after what she literally just said before but this might be Snapfire being confident in the fact that their alliance do to being under the same Ancient will keep Mortimer safe.

&amp;#x200B;

Queen of Pain's Eminence of Ristul also has 2 lines that reinforce the other lines.  [The Eminence of Ristul Bundle/Responses - Dota 2 Wiki (gamepedia.com)](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_Eminence_of_Ristul_Bundle/Responses)

""*Why am I even talking to you*?"" she's basically saying since you can't talk back why bother.

""*Mindless is useless in my book.*"" implying the Oath has possibly wiped him of personality completely and is nothing more than a monster.

&amp;#x200B;

Windranger's Compass of the Rising Gale continues this trend.  [Compass of the Rising Gale Bundle/Responses - Dota 2 Wiki (gamepedia.com)](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Compass_of_the_Rising_Gale_Bundle/Responses)

""*You know a quip feels kind of wasted on him, but I guess we quip for ourselves more than anything.*"" now we know it's a ""him"" for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally our most significant lines are from our newest hero Hoodwink.  [Hoodwink/Responses - Dota 2 Wiki (gamepedia.com)](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Hoodwink/Responses)

""*Nah yeah...thought I might be seeing you when I noticed your leash was nicked. No hard feelings?*"" This is an ally meet line and is already adding on to a possible relationship to the Beast hero and Hoodwink since she's implying she wronged him somehow. Not only that, but we know that the Oath is either broken or control was reassigned to someone else since nicked could mean either stolen or cut.

""*We used to be friends, a long time ago. What say we give it another run?*"" They did know each other at some point so this implies Hoodwink may have betrayed the Beast hero.

""*I couldn't have known everything'd go nuts up like that. Honest!*"" If the Beast hero is Rix, does this mean Hoodwink was the one who recommended taking the Oath, or even starting the Voul rebellion. We know Hoodwink hates groups like the Legion who wipe out forests in the name bloody expansion. Although she may not live there, perhaps she visited or stayed in Roseleaf long enough to meet Rix while the Legion was occupying the city and encouraged Rix to take a stand against the Legions oppression.

""*We coulda been great together. But you always get blinded by the floodlights...*"" This line might imply that Hoodwink was romantically interested in Rix, might have just wanted him to run away from the Legion and join her as a nomadic forest dweller, but his commitment to the Legion and eventual siding with the Voul meant she could have encouraged him to do something drastic to get away from the Legion.

There is three more lines that are significant, but it's not an ally or enemy line like the others, it's item pick up lines for Gleipnir, one of the items added with Hoodwink.

[ \\""Bindings forged by impossible means to leash an ancient evil.\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/mdk7658dumm61.png?width=88&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7f650c227979c3171a79a00aa46b5857558a4c)

""Wait, if the Gleipnir's here. Then he's... I gotta go.""

""You really should've left this thing where it was, for all our sakes.""

"" Aw mate, do you know how hard I had to work to get that thing the first time I needed it? ""

These are all extremely significant. In Dota context they don't mean much, but in Norse Mythology, we can start drawing parallels between the Beast hero, Rix, and his Norse inspiration Fenrir!

https://preview.redd.it/q9dk9yymumm61.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca971f7eed1311dc913b6e726aa59b406cbc6009

Fenrir in Norse mythology is a son of Loki and notably very large wolf. He was born and raised in Asgard among the gods, but prophecies soon emerged that this beast would become too powerful and kill Odin during Ragnarok (a great battle followed by immense natural disasters). The gods fearing Fenrir's eventual wrath tried to bind him with chains multiple times, but each time Fenrir broke free do to his great strength. Eventually, the gods commissioned the dwarves to forge and unbreakable chain created from impossible means that would bind Fenrir and save Odin from his fate in Ragnarok, this chain was Gleipnir, It was successful in binding Fenrir, but during the events of Ragnorok he was able to break free of his bindings and take his revenge on Odin.

This story is not only an excellent example of how actions to prevent something can go horribly wrong, but it is also has striking parallels to Rix's own story of struggling for freedom. Fenrir was also depicted as a large pitch black wolf, which is exactly what Rix seems to be becoming after taking the Oath.

One god of dota 2 is already aware of Shadow Fiend and the court of Ristul in Artifact and are aware of the terrifying potential the Oath has. This god is the Omniscience, and it has sent Omniknight to partner with Luna and her goddess Selemene to stop the Court.

[\\""Something is stirring in Roseleaf. I'm not referring to Stonehall's war machine, or the Red Mist Horde... no... those are problems of flesh and blood, distractions keeping attention divided from the real danger. The Court of Ristul. But I cannot face this danger alone, and so I hope to meet with Luna of the Dark Moon. With the combined might of Selemene and the All Seeing One, we may have a chance.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/lksjdd5tumm61.png?width=401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2705e746e7a0883b4b34b40c0b7b86112ae9469)

Finally, Ragnarok is a battle in Norse Mythology so violent the gods did everything in their power to prepare for it. I believe the parallel for this battle wasn't the battle of Roseleaf, but what was possibly Artifact's next expansion, the battle of Stonehall. Obviously Artifact didn't get an expansion with any lore so this is head cannon, but with the card art added for Artifact 2.0 and how the Artifact timeline was developing, I think we were going to get a new look at the battle of stone hall. Now to quickly catch you up since the original dota and Artifact timelines are a little weird since they have people messing with time in order to sway events, I'll surmise them.

Original Dota timeline: Legion commander returns to Stonehall to see it in flames, Underlord Vrogross is attacking and laying waste to the city. Tresdin's Forces battle with the Underlords forces, eventually leading to Tresdin pushing Underlord back through the Portal he came from. With Stonehall desimated and her forces wiped out Tresdin embarks on a quest to take revenge on Underlord.

Artifact timeline: Sorla Kahn becomes leader of the new Red Mist Horde and leads them on a campaign to destroy Stonehall and the Bronze Legion. She goes through Roseleaf and defeats Tresdins occupation due to the Voul rebellion's sabotage and the total chaos of the battle. The Voul rebellion is quashed, and Rix becomes fully Oath bound as per his arrangement with Shadowfiend.

Now, thanks to the Quop's Eminence of Ristul comic ""ascension"" we know that both Shadowfiend and Underlord are members of the Court of Ristul, and that Underlord is DEFINITELY planning to take Stonehall.

These panels are tell us this comic is in the Artifact timeline.

All of this together tells us that the battle of Stonehall is not only the Abyssal Legions versus the Bronze legion, but also Shadowfiend's Voul forces, undead, and personal demon army vs the Red Mist Horde. Stonehall is Dota battle of Ragnarok. This leads me to my final point of head cannon to fill in some gaps.

https://preview.redd.it/kjbu62rpvmm61.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84115b43998698f035618f2eebecaec048948819

&amp;#x200B;

Artifact is dead, if what I've shown was meant to be the story of the 2nd expansion it's not likely going to be explored until far later down the line, and for now none of this is cannon. Let me summarize and paint the full picture.

Rix is conscripted by the Bronze Legion, he is a soldier in their army, he is respected by his fellow soldiers and Tresdin, but knows he is not truly free. He Starts the Voul rebellion of Roseleaf, removes his bronze bull snake, a metallic mark of his conscription, he's broken free from the Legion and fights for the people of Roseleaf. Like Fenrir he has broken free of his binds for the first time.

https://preview.redd.it/ygclk4u2wmm61.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=158168fca24cf94dfc81e9403f0ac545f26ef4df

Rix took the Oath in order to escape the Legion, he gained power at the eventual cost of his freedom. Little did he know that his failure also cost the freedom of the Voul he tried to protect. He was once again bound to a new master, with even less freedom, an even darker cause, and no chance at fighting back.

https://preview.redd.it/4jht7hq5wmm61.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2f14a7130fd7070a7ad9ad13fd0326ddc1b6726

This is as far as cannon got, but if I were to assume how Rix's story ends, it would be with the beginning of Fenrir. Whether it was of Rix's own desire and will to take freedom, or his guilt for dooming the Voul to a life of tormented servitude to demon lords that couldn't be escaped even in death, or yet another darker power we've yet to understand, Rix broke free from his binds of the Oath during the battle of Stonehall, becoming a demonic monstrosity beyond all measure, freeing the Voul from the Oaths control and reaping revenge on everything that tried or will try to contain him. Losing himself in the overwhelming freedom of this new power, Rix ceased to exist. Now he is Fenrir.

https://preview.redd.it/vkr7iuebwmm61.jpg?width=511&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f00d75966ef14380e78443d46ec9cc635e1dde4

Some closing notes, Artifact is gone so even if this was the original vision of Rix's story and Artifact's for that matter, it's likely it could be changed or reworked for future content to dota and maybe underlords assuming it isn't axed next. I just had to make this thread because Rix is still my favorite Artifact hero among a large list of great heroes added. What's still cannon for his lore is very compelling to me. He tried to fight the odds and almost got away with it. Little did he know how hard he would have to fight to find the freedom to carve his own path. He wasn't just defying the Legion, he was defying fate itself. When I hear those unreleased voice lines for the Beast hero, when I hear how mocking and cruel they are, it reminded me that to other dota heroes looking at Rix and the events that transpired in Roseleaf, it looks like just another greedy creature trying to gain power at any cost like so many others. That's the final parallel I have to draw to finalize this. The gods in dota lore don't like people who defy them. Monkey king gained power and sought to cause mischief against the gods and was sealed in a mountain, bound for centuries. Roshan, a massive and powerful beast, turned so after killing a shopkeeper and claiming the aegis, now left to remain in a pit, contained, ready to be killed at any moment over and over and over again. Rix, defied the Legion, defied the court of Ristul, and now as this creature of immense power, Fenrir, sought to once again defy the gods, and so they commissioned Gleipnir, binds made by impossible means to stop a powerful beast who would seek to show they aren't all they aren't all powerful. That not everyone can be bound, some can rise above, some can be free.

Edit: Since there are lots of people having a similar problem (sudden fps drop, in my case 0 fps for 3 seconds, even in Overwatch reviews), what is the best way to forward this issue to the devs?

2. Edit: The error can occur when a 'new' animation gets animated for the first time, e.g. if it is the first time I use a spell, the game will freeze loading that animation. Multiple uses afterwards are less likely to trigger FPS drops. This issue can happen repeatedly on using voice chat, but not in every instance of the game.

In the 7 games that i have played tonight, 6 of them were complete stomps, 4 of them had people rage buybacking and buying shadow amulet, and i had never seen the shadow amulet grief prior to tonight, and now i've seen it 3 times.

I can't actually imagine how the people who are raging and/or actively ruining games function in real life, it just blows my mind.

Ive given up the thought of playing like moderate people because it always ends up escalating to insane proportions. Anyhow this tip has been a lifesaver for me to wake up / sleep normal times. Try it out if you havent already, its worth a shot.",DotA2

t3_m3y5zy,Making Dota More Positive,"A lot has been said about the negativity and toxicity in Dota. A lot less time has been spent on how to make it better, so here are some of my thoughts on overcoming negativity and toxicity.

Understand that most people aren't trying to be bad - it's easy to think look at a player making an ""obvious"" mistake, even repeatedly, and going ""wtf, why are they doing this bad thing"". I think a useful thing to think about is why a player is bad to begin with:

1. knowledge - they're not aware/don't remember that a certain things is bad

1. perception - they're misreading the situation, e.g. thinking they're stronger than they actually are, thinking the enemy is far when they're near, etc.

1. execution - there's always going to be a gap between ideal and what we're capable of -- even with perfect knowledge players are going to mess their mechanics up (e.g. not look at the minimap enough, fail the pull, cast spells in the wrong order/at the wrong time), and that's where practice comes in, i.e. playing games!

So if a player is bad, what are you going to do about it? Flaming them usually doesn't work, and just makes people defensive most of the time. Instead, try and make them better. Here are some Do's and Don'ts on communicating feedback:

1. DO: Try and identify which aspect is lacking: knowledge, perception or execution?
1. DO: Give feedback without judgement or blame. State the goal and the solution or what you expect to happen -- ""we need vision to push, ward here so we get vision around X"" or ""don't focus on the Bristleback, go for the backline first""
1. DO: Be as specific as you can, e.g. ""take the tower and back"" vs ""let's push"".
1. DO: Accept that feedback may not be absorbed quickly, correctly or fully. It's hard to fully process feedback in one go, especially in the middle of the game. It takes time to improve.
1. DON'T: Ask them why they're doing what they're doing. They're doing it because it makes sense/doesn't seem bad to them.
1. DON'T: Focus on the past. What's over is over. Figure out what needs to happen now and in the future.
1. DON'T: Get caught up with winning. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose

t3_m4fcdj,Why everybody in this sub is so against adding a surrender option?,"The last couple of weeks have been dominated by posts about grieving in the form of fountain farming. Right now you can see posts about it in the front page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m48621/todays_overwatch_case_is_interesting_it_is_one/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m49gfs/how_i_got_an_unintentional_abandon/), and in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m3nvhy/this_is_why_you_shouldnt_fountain_farm/) case where it didn't worked out. 

Anyway, the point is that it's still a real problem in Dota 2, something that ruins the enjoyment of the game to everybody, but as importantly, may have made tons of news players to quit the game forever, since they are the ones more vulnerable to this kind of exploit and don't know cope meachanisms (like blinking to the trees or shadow amulet), to never get back to the game again. If you wonder why every dota player has more than 25 years old, and new people seems to never get in, you can in part thanks this ""feauture"". 

My point is that something should be done against that, since it is a real problem. Some would say ""just buff the fountain"", but Icefrog have done many times since the game started, with the most recent one being in [7.27](https://www.oneesports.gg/dota2/dota-2-patch-7-27-revamps-economy-removes-zoo-meta-and-adds-two-new-items/), with still no success in lowering the attempts.   


I'm really calling Valve that something more effective should be done to end it one for all, and just giving some more attack to the fountain doesn't seem to be it. The surrender option is one possible solution, because at the end of the day, what's the point to extend a casual game if the other five players don't want to play anymore? Who is being hurt by it?   


I don't think it would doom the game, League of Legends has it from the 5 minutes and beyond, and you still get more than [30 minutes games](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/game-durations/na), which you can point out to other factors beside the existence of the surrender option, like how farm, high ground and tower works there.   


But if people are still against surrender, for whatever religious reason may be, other solutions should be considered, like just making people in fountain invulnerable, or make it a aura with 20+ armor and 50% magic resistance aura, so at least, this problem can be solved one for all.",DotA2

1. Ogre + Kotl, with Kotl maxing solar Bind and ogre maxing ignite. Once the lane hits level 3-5. The solar bind slow+dmg amp + the ignite damage and cooldown reduction basically destroys the lane for any combo that doesn't have a dispell.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Abbadon with green boots, and locket. The Deathcoils become a 300HP heal on a 5 second cooldown for 50 mana, and it doesn't interrupt the green boots. Add on a mek at some point, and you can burst heal with mek + locket + deathcoil + shield + second deathcoil  for (300+300+300+250+300  = 1450 on a pos5 with barely any items); Which is absolutely insane considering that's 1450 hp BEFORE their mitigation.

Putting that aside, aphoticshield + deathcoil, completely stops snowballing enemy mids, because it completely throws off their power spike. They can't get kills when they need to, in order to snowball. (Eg. OD, meteor hammer)

First let's consider heroes without any items, and then, let's consider the same heroes with Heart of Tarrasque. To account for some of the talents and stat gain per level, the comparison point will be level20 with first no items, and then just the heart of tarrasque.

**Base stats**

Centaur Warrunner:   
Strength: 27 + 4.6 x level  
Agility: 15 + 1.0 x level  
Armor: 2.5  
Talents: N/A (Note: Retaliate damage)  
Abilities: N/A (Note: Retaliate and stampede)

Phantom Assassin:  
Strength: 21 + 2.2 x level  
Agility: 23 + 3.4 x level  
Armor: 4.8  
Talents: 175 health + 12% Lifesteal + 35% evasion  
Abilities: Blur (Note: Phantom Strike)

Spectre  
Strength: 23 + 2.5 x level  
Agility: 23 + 2.1 x level  
Armor: 3.8  
Talents: 5 stats + 400 health  
Abilities: Dispersion (Note: Reality, Spectral Dagger)  


**No items, level 20:**

Centaur Warrunner:   
Health: 2480  
Armor: 5  
Mitigation: N/A  
**EHP: 3224**

Phantom Assassin:  
Health: 1590  
Armor: 15  
Mitigation: Blur (80% Evasion)  
**EHP: 3021**  
**EHP MAX Mitigation: 15105**

Spectre  
Health: 2100  
Armor: 11.3  
Mitigation: Dispersion (Max 20%)  
**EHP: 3523**  
**EHP MAX Mitigation: 4404**  


**Heart of Tarrasque, level 20:**

Centaur Warrunner:   
Health: 3630  
Armor: 5  
Mitigation: N/A  
**EHP: 4719**

Phantom Assassin:  
Health: 2740  
Armor: 15  
Mitigation: Blur (80% Evasion)  
**EHP: 5206**  
**EHP MAX Mitigation: 26030**

Spectre  
Health: 3250  
Armor: 11.3  
Mitigation: Dispersion (Max 20%)  
**EHP: 5453**  
**EHP MAX Mitigation: 6816**

Notably though this only applies for physical damage that gets reduced by armor, and more over Phantom's mitigation can be pierced with Maelstrom, Mjollnir or Monkey King Bar etc. But the bottom line is that Phantom Assassin has a graceful model, that gives you an image of a delicate female heroine, and Centaur Warrunner looks rather masculine and bulky, but in the end, Centaur has low base agility, and basically very low armor, and despite having high strength gain per level, they're not really tanky at all, at least when taking physical damage.

Of course to get the full picture, you'd need to use some sort of a distribution for different types of damage, and peruse the options these heroes have to upgrade their survivability. Which also means that some of the physical damage can be evasion piercing, and some of it not.   
But basically because in one area Phantom is already rather covered due to high armor and free evasion, they can more easily afford to take something like Pipe of Insight. Not that it's a good idea to build one, but if you wanted to make a tanky hero and these 3 to choose from.. Well If you look at the above statements, you might wonder if the Centaur is the least tanky of the 3.   


At least I think so. What do you think? Answer the poll and let us know in the comments.

There's this idea that if developers are working on Artifact or Underlords, its taking away resources from the development of Dota 2. Even though it has the largest development team in Valve compared to any other game!

Valve made a lot of mistakes regarding Artifact and Underlords. No doubt about that. They officially ended development on Artifact, and word is, its the same for Underlords. That game was getting consistent, frequent updates but then suddenly stopped and hasn't got an update in over 3 months.

Despite this, we should be happy that Valve even want to expand the Dota Universe with other games. They don't even touch other franchises as much as Dota! Remember, after the release of Dota 2 in 2013, there wasn't a single Valve game released other than those in the Dota Universe itself. Only in 2020 they finally went back to the Half-Life franchise with a prequel.

Remember when Riot announced all those different games in different genres based on the LOL franchise couple years ago? Valve have been doing the same (only worse :P). But that doesn't mean we should lose hope. They are about to release an anime, and that's awesome. But we should hope and root for more Dota games too. I see the biggest potential in an RPG or RTS game. Its not likely that they'll make a shooter or fighting game based on Dota.

t3_m3on97,Some Overwatch Feedback,"I really enjoy overwatch. I think its a nice way to kill time while I wait for my friends to get on to play. Its also quite fun to do in groups using discord. But it has some glaring issues and I think they need to be addressed.

First: Either completely rework or remove the ""Markers"".

In my experience, these markers are almost completely useless, if not downright misleading. I have had multiple overwatch cases where the player in question was completely innocent in each of the markers, but after skipping around the rest of the game I found blatant instances of griefing/cheating/feeding. I suspect many people are just skipping through the markers, seeing nothing wrong, and reporting an innocent verdict when there may have been blatant wrongdoing elsewhere in the replay. In my opinion, it would be best to remove the markers altogether. The person reviewing the case already has a ~15 minute clip cut from a much longer match, and they have access to a 16x fast forward option. Fast forwarding through the clip without markers and watching the offender for anything that looks off is a way more effective way to review these clips.

Second: Show us more context. Show us all chat and team chat. Show us who reported who. Show us when the report occurred.  

Sometimes gameplay doesnt show the whole story. If a player is sharing information about ward locations in chat, thats griefing. If a player has a bad death and gets reported by all 4 of his teammates, while otherwise playing a perfectly normal game, show us that. We can gleam a lot of information out of the non-gameplay facets of the report, and that helps make a more informed verdict.

Lastly: Give us feedback about people getting punishment, the same way you do for reports. 

If Im doing overwatch, and I submit a guilty verdict, it would be nice to hear back that action was taken. I dont know how much weight the overwatch verdict has on whether or not the reported player is punished, but it always feels good to see that notification when I report someone, and I imagine that feeling would carry over for overwatch.

Puck just needs a totally different aghanim's scepter altogether, because allowing dreamcoil to pierce bkb for a FOUR SECOND BKB PIERCING STUN is just ridiculous.

I don't even mind if other aspects of Puck got buffed, at least they require skill to use. But aghanim's scepter dreamcoil really doesn't require skill to use since there is no counterplay to it. You blink in and dream coil their team, and job done, countered by nothing",DotA2
t3_m47pdm,Stop griefing because of jungle LC's(pos 4). It's one of the most OP heroes if played well. Or a ruined game if you can't play her.,"I love jungle LC. I have a 60% wr with her in pubs, and it would be easily an 80% if it wasnt because of the griefers.

When played well she can snowball the game in 20min and create enough space for the rest to farm, and I can only compare her with Alchemist mid in that regard. 

The only way you can stop a good jungle LC is the same as with a good Alche mid: if one of the supps leaves his lane and not only wards/block all of the jungle camps, but their camps as well (I even won games were my griefing teammates warded my camps lol). Or constantly tries to gank her (which is a win even if she gets ganked since a lot of space is created). 

 Now, that being said, I hate playing with other jungle LC's and I would definitely report them, because they don't know how to play her in that position.

A good jungle LC is an overly active roaming supp 4 and ganker. She doesn't stay jungle when the team needs her, she buys time with smokes and TP's, so she can farm, but the top priority is to support the lanes. 

If you are a jungle LC lover, or you are just griefing because your 4 picked a carry and is taking all your offlane farm, please follow the following advice:

&amp;#x200B;

1. &gt;!Watch a video about how to farm jungle LC in the current patch. Valve changes the forest to keep you from your meta, but people always finds a way :)!&lt;
2. &gt;!Get some attack speed, armor and mana. Level only 2 and 3.!&lt;
3. &gt;!You have 5min to farm urself some PT (for this to work you can't have PBs). Now don't forget yu are a 4 , so if a lane gets attacked, you go and heal/help them, then gtfo and go back to farm. Specially take care of the mid lane.!&lt;
4. &gt;!By min 5-6 you have to be LVL 6 and have pt. As soon as you get the duel, buy a smoke and go to the most advanced lane (or the one with the weakest hero), either mid or safe, but sometimes off is possible with a TP. !&lt;
5. &gt;!Ping the hell out of your objective, and get to them from behind with smoke and duel. You should easily earn the duel if you did this well. 
!&lt;
6. &gt;!You go back to farm and by min 10-12max you have to get yourself a SB. No daggers, only a SB works in this role,because you need the extra dmg. !&lt;
7. &gt;!Once you have the SB the fun starts. From here on you are a roaming 4 and don't go back to jungle again. You constantly start scanning for lone heros and duel opportunities. Arm yourself with a smoke at all times. !&lt;
8. &gt;!Your algo is: spot, tp, smoke, sneak, attack, moment of courage, and duel, retreat. !&lt;
9. &gt;!Depending on how the process goes, you can either go as an utility LC with Solar Crest, Vlads, Atos. Or as a situational carry with a desolator, daedalus, etc.  Blade mail is situational as well, you should rely on items and duel for damage, not the splash damage.!&lt;

&gt;!This role plays really well against weak int-agi teams since you can gank them alone and earn fast duels. It also plays well against passive-dependant heroes that otherwise would be a pain in the ass of ur team (Timber, Axe, Ursa, Pa, etc) since you can prioritize a Silver Edge and remove it and easily kill them.!&lt;

&gt;!Dont fucking EVER buy a midas. NEVER EVER. You will delay your snowball for 10 minutes, and every minute is vital for this role to work!!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you are an Offlaner, and your 4 picked LC. Please tell him to go jungle and what to buy. And you yourself, pick an Offlane that can resist 5min without dying. And it will be a GG :)",DotA2

t3_m3oq6r,"Can we get an alc nerf already? ACID Spray, Swift Blink Buffs and Rapier buffs have made the hero broken.","I feel as though this hero is nearly 100% pick/ban at the professional level and is in every single fucking pub that it isn't banned. Giving the fastest farming carrying in Dota and INSANELY strong laning spell with an EXTREMELY low downtime seems pretty stupid to me. This and this spell alone has provided the hero the versatility to be played in this offlone rush aghs meta popularized by OG. 

Acid Spray is TIDE (see what I did there) for the highest lvl 1 armor reduction spell in Dota expect its a fucking AOE that last for 16 fucking seconds and does DOT. I legit think this spell is better level 1 than Meta at its current state and meta has a 155s CD. It doesnt matter how good of level 1 heros u have, if you dont full to 0 a 700 hp hero you CANNNOT fight into this hero.

However, Acid Spray has been this strong for a pretty long while so let's explore the other things that make this Low-Skill braindead hero so easy to play a caveman can do it. Alc is no longer a hero that falls off as the game goes later and later, i would instead agrue that in his currently state he the best late game carry in all of dota. The combination of his ability to farm at 1k GPM with the addition of Upgraded Blinks, along with buffs to rapier and his own dispell in his shard (that also gives 40 hp/s) makes it such that this hero out carries EVERYONE. (Im aware he has some harder matchups such as Jug or Ursa - Perhaps he does not out carry them)

Game going poorly? Make space for 5 minutes for him to get a rapier. Hell he can even sell his BFury bc for some reason the hero has a free Bfury at 20. Win 1 fight with a rapier, oh sick now you've got swift blink and have 900 MS with INSANE attack speed. AND THIS POST DOEST EVEN MENTION THE INSANITY THAT IS SPIDER LEGS (please remove this busted af item) 

Now sure the argument will be the same as it always is with alc. Just play faster, invade his jungle, and take early towers. While I completely agree this is how to play against the hero, it feels to me that the margin for error in the playstyle needed to beat the hero is much smaller than it has been in the past.

In closing, I would like to give my recommendation on balancing that way rather than just merely bitching I can provide what I think is a solution. Acid Spray armor reduction 2/2/3/4. Swift blink no longer unlocks max MS OR Swift blink no longer provides attack damage. Swift blink provides no additional movement speed if spider legs are equipped.",DotA2
t3_m3raha,What Dota players and Medieval Europe has in common?,"No, not the lack of shower (which is a myth by the way), but the enthusiatic way that they look for scapegoats when things get sour. 

Black Plague is ravaging Europe in 1340s and killing 1/3 of its population? Must be a punishement from Gods because jews exists, that weirdos who don't love Jesus, wipe them from here. It has nothing to do with fleas or rats. 

The same way, the average team starts to lose, maybe because they picked bad fights, didn't pressure the map, overextended, didn't timed their ultimates well, got an awnfull lane stage, general lack of coordination, etc... Actually no, the reason why we are losing totally is the fact that Luna bought Aganhim, this Naga Siren support, this Alchemist giving free aganhims to his teammates, this Tiny which built bloothorn to help with disables, etc... Dota 2 is a game of fixed builds and pre-concieved formulas, where just ONE single build works for that specific hero, there is no variation, nothing in between. If someone plays different from what you used for = grieving.  

Just to be clear, I'm not talking about people who selected a certain role and then refuse to play it, or obvious troll cuilds who would never work in ranked setting where the players has some playing field in terms of abilities (like desolator + mark of madness crystal maiden). 

What I'm saying is that people in this game are quick to shout ""grieving!"" for anything that is a bit different from the usual build, like if you had to always play the same meta heroes, the same way as everyone else, to have any chance of winning. But this is not how the game actually works.",DotA2

t3_m3mqd2,Some old memories of old dota around 2004 version 5.54 onwards,"So I began playing Dota around 2004 and I just wanted to share some memories.

My favourite mode was -apem. All pick easy mode. Weaker towers and more gold/xp if I remember correctly.

 Games would go for too long otherwise.

This was before we could get couriers and in the early days the support would buy one and then share control with everyone else to give them access to it.

We had a different forum back then. 
I only remember the moderator Mafaga with the Panda profile pic. We had to download Dota from that website and then go to battle.net to join the game.

I recall really enjoying 5.84B. couldn't tell you why. Just was fun.

Axe was pretty OP when first introduced. Battle hunger was endless until that hero killed a unit.

I liked the original names and still call them that in my head. 

Magina for AM, Mortred for PA and Kael for Invoker. Guinsoo for sheepstick. I remember waves where a certain hero would be OP and would almost guarantee and win and then they'd nerf them next patch. Mostly carries of course.

PL was so impressive to me when he first came around. I remember playing him a lot at first just because it was so cool to see the illusions show up.

SA had death ward as his ulti and was pretty OP those days. So many gems and truesight wards were purchased. Dust wasn't around back then.

You could buy Aegis before and it had 3 charges from memory. Also Roshan was on the right side of the middle lane. It does throw me off every now and then to visit him in the left side.

The trash talking, rage quitting and immaturity has always been there. These days it doesn't bother me. Most of them now probably weren't even born when I began playing 17 years ago.

I remember there was a fake version 7.00 that had snow falling and the heroes were more broken.

I've since lost all of the replays and screenshots and I can see that it's possible to download those versions again. 

Part of me wants to go through the trouble of reinstalling Warcraft 3 TFT and reopen the map.

t3_m41xz0,I wish there was a queue for only solo players.,"While being a part of a premade lobby can be fun, being a solo player in a lobby that is otherwise full of premades is one of the worst experiences in Dota, on par with being a new player and running into smurfs, and there are a lot of reasons.

1. No matter what happens, it's your fault. A 4-stack will never blame each other, and will always attempt to pin any mistakes on the solo. Enigma solo black holed a guy you had darted a full second prior as Riki? Clearly it's your fault for throwing him off.
2. These guys are communicating their plans in Discord. As such, they will almost never feel the need to communicate with *you*. They'll decide amongst themselves that they want to smoke gank somebody, they'll come to you as you farm an ancient stack, and then pop the smoke before you finish clearing it, resulting in you breaking smoke to finish your camp.
3. In the event you're playing mid alongside two 2-stacks, and they're all laning with their friends, the odds of anyone coming to gank for you are basically none. Hope an 11 minute radiance on that Alch isn't a problem!
4. Because they're ""playing with friends"" in their mind, they see no problem with doing wacky/stupid shit. Gleipnir rush support Warlock? Sure! Diving tier 3's with two rapiers as TA? Why not! That fifth guy doesn't exist!
5. They are under no obligation to play with friends of equal skill. You might have a 5k Lich dragging his 750 MMR Sniper friend into your mid-level pubs, instantly ruining the game.",DotA2

I find it pretty annoying for two reasons: 1) many people are bad at timing it and end up costing the team money when they pick too late; 2) it just makes the whole process take more time.

Is there any reason why people do this? At first I thought they were attempting to conceal their pick until the last moment, so the enemy team could not counter pick. Of course, your character is concealed any ways until both teams have picked their characters, so this cannot be the reason.

Perhaps people are just thinking really hard about what character they want to play, and require the full 30 seconds to do so?",DotA2

Yes, it's a game, but it's also our time.","When you queue up for a game, of course you're doing it to enjoy yourself, to have fun. If you're queueing up in a game such as Dota 2, then you understand it is a team game and there will be other players to work with. Those are other people, not computer programs or NPCs, but actual people who are doing the same.

You understand that the time spent in queue is to get into a game and have fun for the duration of that game, whether it is 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or longer. But when someone starts griefing a game, that time is being stolen from them. That's no longer the time in queue and a game of 20-30 minutes or longer of enjoyment, it's now suffering and waiting for it to be over. That time is now wasted because there's nothing that can be done about it.

Winning and losing isn't as big of a deal in unranked and turbo, it's not ranked, but that doesn't excuse someone ruining it. That doesn't make their actions any less deplorable, and it doesn't change the fact that their teammates are suffering because of them.",DotA2

Now I can see it's a shitty thing to do from Pudge, but I had to cast the griefing verdict to WK because he was the one that actually threw the game.

If instead WK had reported the Pudge and just kept farming, I would have voted Pudge guilty.

t3_m2qjoq,Role queue farmers should not be given a free pass to troll games," One of the most frustrating things other than smurfs, account buyers and boosters are role queue farmers.

I'm talking players who have finished their role queue tickets and are now queueing all roles to farm tokens. More often than not, I see these players picking garbage like pos 5 pudge or some off meta picks like offlane techies, pos 5 am etc. I'm not against off meta picks, but if you do pick those you better have a damn good reason to back it up and actually try to win the game.

The problem is players farming queue tokens treat these games as a mandatory ""get it over and done with"" game and clearly don't give a fuck about winning, because who cares? They still get the tokens win or lose.

My suggestion: Make it so that if you get reported by 3 people in your team for not playing your role, if your team loses, you do not get any role queue tokens. If you team wins, you still get 4. This will encourage people to still play the game properly even though they are not in their preferred role.

Obviously this won't stop role queue farmers who are griefing the game by not cooperating even they picked a reasonable hero, but there is always overwatch for that.",DotA2

t3_m31p1t,"DPC Teams possibly being allowed to keep their slot, even after major roster changes - thoughts?","The EU and CIS DPC are about to begin open qualifiers for the second season. I will be talking about EU in this one as I am not sure about if there are CIS teams from season 1 disbanding.

The EU open qual will bring 8 teams into a closed qual, where two will then be entered into the league (replacing the relegated teams). Where this becomes interesting is the fact that more than just the two relegated teams no longer exist in the lower division from season 1. Team Spider Pigzs has announced their disbandment and team Creepwave has presumably disbanded (removed 3 players from the major registration website).

I don't think it is incorrect to say that it is usually the case that teams that removed 3/5 or even 4/5 of their roster get their spots forfeited and must qualify again with whatever their lineup. There being only 2 slots for the closed qualifier, however, implies that team Creepwave and Spider Pigzs must be retaining their slots, despite going through massive roster changes. Presumably at least 1/5 or 2/5 of the original players would be constructing a new stack and get to inherit the slots. 

Now, maybe the closed qualifier will eventually change and it will be accepting more teams - not sure. Just going off of the information we have now.

For more examples, A-Team in NA has removed 3 players, and will presumably still get to play in Lower Div season 2 with whatever their new roster is without needing to do a new qualifier.

Why in the fuck would you wait 6 months for a ban wave? [These shartnuggets](https://www.dotabuff.com/players/311968139/matches) need to be banned WAY sooner. Look at this dudes green (victories) line. Lmao. What a joke.

If this isn‚Äôt one of the most blatant examples of matchmaking abuse, I don‚Äôt know what the hell anyone looks at to grade said behaviours. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, even if this guy got banned tomorrow ‚Äî he got 50 good games in of slaughtering and ruining the game integrity for others. That‚Äôs a victory for his serotonin levels.

In just 7 days, this smurf has added to the ruination of 50 matches. And we‚Äôre expecting to wait months before justice will be served? 

If they only ban every few months, that‚Äôs a beyond broken system. Even if the guy paid $100 for a rank-ready herald account, that‚Äôs paid for itself within what? 5-10 matches of entertainment? So they get to pop off hundreds before any action is taken?

The account will have lost its low ranking status within months of play and by the time it gets ""banned"" its already been abandoned by the smurf, because it's climbed rank to a plateau level. This literally does nothing to fix the problem in the moment.

What a broken system that there isn‚Äôt more specific metrics in place to identify the gaps in gameplay for this account accompanied by a drastic change in overall results (from this acct‚Äôs shitty scores against heralds/guardians 6 months ago to coming back and going 32-1-30 as Ember Spirit (1 example).

t3_m37uby,Old Report system(?)+ Overwatch = ?,"Since Overwatch has been implemented i've never went to LP and the max amount of reports i've got in conduct summary was 4(once), that's good, but that also makes me think that we're having old punishment system.

Basically Old system didn't know whether you're guilty or not, so you'd go through many games and recieve many reports for you to go to LP. It also took notice what behavior score you had before, so if you had 10k and you abandoned you'd be restricted for mm for 30 min, if you had 2k behavior score you'd be restricted for a day and go play 5 LP games(don't ask me how i know).

But here's the problem, Overwatch system already knows whether you're guilty or not, you don't need to give old reports and drop player's behavior score slowly.

Let's say hypothetically, support player doesn't give mid player last pick, so mid player picks meepo, buys all wards, goes mid, drops wards on the ground, dies to the tower and abandons the game. That dude should get 30 min ban for abandoning and his case should be moved straight to the beginning of the Overwatch queue, reviewed and punished for 1 day ban and -2k behavior score with 5 games LP, but since i've never heard of this happening from other players, i'm assuming it works the old way, which is pathetic considering there is a proof of guilt.",DotA2

Usually one team piles on as much of a lead as possible so that many people place their bets on them. And when the odds for the enemy team are good enough, a pause occurs with no explanation or disconnects which leads to a sudden game losing throw by the team with the massive lead.

Save for the few legitimate technical pauses, a lot of tier 2 matchfixed games have these pauses to discuss how the game is to be thrown. Usually minutes before the game ends, or minutes before one team gets 10 kills.

Currently I'm exploring the world of a really epic Zombie apocalypse sandbox game, while also taking on the street racers of another open-world epic street racing game.

&amp;#x200B;

I still enjoy watching DotA streams during dinner / when I'm taking a break from smashing undead skulls/racing records..for now.

t3_m3fe1f,Fix backdoor protection in turbo,Natures prophet just tps to towers from lvl 1 and rats every building in the game because backdoor protection doesn't work.  I afk the start of one game and don't ban it and it happens.  Valve fix this please.  I refuse to believe that it's a hard fix.,DotA2
t3_m3gnl8,DotA is being played a lot less - analysis," This   is a very simple analysis anyone can make by himself (well, its   statistics). Anyone can make it, and even more detailed. For example per   each month. We made this per year with the dates 20xx-03-12.

We took 3 match IDs and compared them.

matches:  
2021-03-12 ... ID-5882017360  
2020-03-12 ... ID-5287540575  
2019-03-12 ... ID-4521443573

The calculation is very simple:  
We calculate the count of matches played during the two intervals:  
last year ... 5882017360 - 5287540575 = 594,476,785  
year before ... 5287540575 - 4521443573 = 766,097,002

We can see a significant loss.

Lets make some % out of this:  
594,476,785 / 766,097,002 = 0.7760  
0.7760 - 1 = -0.2240 (remove the - of course)  
0.2240 \* 100 = 22.40%

From this comparison we can see that for the last year DotA 2 is being played 22.40 % less compared to a year before.

Note:  
Average  game length is not being included in the calculation. Matches should be  multiplied by the average game length during the time interval. However  this is just an interesting point and not really a complex analysis.  The result could be lower or even higher - if the average game length of  the period was lower than the one before.

It   is interesting that the count of unique players in last month is not   declining this fast - based on my observations. Its decreasing much   slower than matches being played, which means that here is more and more   alt accounts per player or the players play DotA 2 less but they are   not leaving. Also turbo mode has been added and it is popular, this   reduced the time spent per match since 2017-10-31, meaning matches after   this date have lesser value.

Lets hope Valve will not rework or hide match IDs after this :D - to hide the relatively massive decline.

Here I will throw some more match IDs from the 20xx-03-12:  
2021-03-12 ... ID-5882017360

So basically what i experience is every sf i meet need 4 item eul travel blink bkb and he gets that around 25 26 min unless hes super snowballing most of my games already over by that time. Because the hero feels really weak without that 25 minn key bkb and the travel cant even payoff because the map is already gone.

Just saw a match were Slark was reported as a griefer, but as far as the replay goes, he was playing normal after the report time stamps. Buut, right in the begging  of the replay, all the jungle was self warded, couldn't see who warded. So I had to go into Opendota/combos,  input that sad lineup and guess what?

t3_m2hnmu,Lane Swapping Guide,"Hello guys! This is Nohu_XIX, I'm a 6K MMR coach/streamer. I mainly play offlane and supports. Today, I'll talk about the forgotten or under-utilized strategy in lower MMR games, which can make the game look so easy, that is LANE SWAPPING.  
  
  
Normally, the carry should go to safe lane, the mid will go to mid, and the offlane will go to hard lane. Soft support will assist the offlaner and the Hard Support will secure the farm of the carry. There are times that your core is countered and will lose the lane. Lane swapping can render the counter useless and gives you the opportunity to counter them.  
  
  
If you are watching pro matches, there's a lot of lane swapping going on. Once they realized that they are countered in the lane, they will go to another lane, they don't care if they lose some of the creeps, as they will lose more if they are countered in the lane. They will walk out and/or TP to another lane. The usual response is the enemy will adjust their laning. The higher MMR you go, the more value you put into the early stage because once you have a good start, you can easily snowball but if you have a bad start, you need to recover first and wait for the enemy to commit mistakes.  
  
  
  
The example that I can give you is one of my ranked matches in which I queued offlane and picked Batrider. Here's the match ID: 5868256321.  
  
    
* Radiant first phase picked Ember Spirit then Enchantress  
* Dire first phase picked Lion then Spirit Breaker  
  
    
I'm thinking that Enchantress will be Hard Support, that hero is really strong in the lane. I'm thinking that the Ember Spirit will go to mid but there's a possibility of him in the support role. I'm thinking of the possible counters now, I'm hovering my mouse in Batrider and I suggested Viper. Spirit Breaker needs a hero that can play with him agressively.  
  
    
* Radiant second phase picked Timbersaw then Juggernaut.  
* Dire second phase picked Batrider and Viper.  
  
    
My mid wants to play Viper so I went for Batrider. Surprisingly, enemy picked Timbersaw, Viper turned out to be a good pick. But my Batrider is countered by Juggernaut...  
  
    
* Radiant last picked Morphling.  
* Dire last picked Weaver.  
  
    
Enemy don't have stuns for Weaver and after seeing their last pick Morphling, we knew that its mid, Juggernaut carry, Timbersaw offlane, Ember Spirit and Enchantress supports. Normally, I will lane with Spirit Beaker in bottom and face Juggernaut and Enchantress. I know that I cannot win that lane, the best result that I can produce is to make it even but it's a very hard task to do, as Spirit Breaker needs level 2 to do something in that lane. I'm considering creep skipping once I got level 3 and ask SB to keep roaming/ganking or stack some neutral camps while I get those experience alone.  
  
  
  
  I suggested to my team (using mic) that we should do some LANE SWAPPING. Weaver ignored me at first but I keep on convincing him. I told him that 
  
  **""Once Timber got levels, he can outsustain you, push towers then create space. Our Viper will win its lane. There's no way that Weaver will die or lose against Juggernaut and Enchantress, their mid cannot gank since it's Morphling and Ember Spirit cannot afford to do a trilane because he needs experience. If I lane against Timbersaw, I can easily win that lane then Spirit Breaker can easily charge in other lanes. If you don't want to swap lanes, I will play against Juggernaut and Enchantress and I'll have a bad start. I cannot create space for you later.""**  
  
The Weaver finally agreed. Maybe he pick Juggernaut as well against Batriders, who knows?  
  
  
In our draft, Weaver is our carry but he needs to play as sacrificial early on, he cannot destroy the Timbersaw in laning unlike Batrider, he will just farm then leave the lane as Timbersaw will become much stronger with levels. It's gonna be different if Batrider has a good start and Timbersaw has a bad start. Batrider and Timbersaw can easily set up the tempo of the game and control the map easily. Good thing in our draft is we have Spirit Breaker can easily follow up and get kills. Spirit Breaker will look good if he has a hero that can play aggressive with. Viper and Lion cannot do it because they are slow.  
  
  
At 10 mins mark, Juggernaut has more farm than Weaver but we think that we managed to win all 3 lanes because Timbersaw don't have a game, Morphling is recovering, Juggernaut cannot fight at all. Ember Spirit is underlevelled, Enchantress will be just a creep after the laning stage. The game ended around 25 mins. We just run at them over and over again until they gave up. They cannot fight us at all because their draft is really greedy. Morphling and Juggernaut? Both needs items and levels. The Timbersaw that should create space for Morphling and Juggernaut is forced to play defensive because of the laning. Bad thing about the enemy, they didn't try to swap the lanes.  
  
  
The analysis that I made in one of my games maybe lacking or wrong but hopefully the concept of lane swapping is there. If you manage to win all 3 lanes, the game feels so easy. Enemy will likely to give up early, possibly they are fighting against each other due to bad start.  
  
  
**TL:DR; Lane swapping or putting the right heroes in the right lane is the first step in victory.**

I understand why Arc cannot have a divine rapier as sending in his clone over and over with no punishment was aids when the hero first came out but there should be a way that the main hero can use a rapier and the clone isn't being sent out with one less item.

Perhaps the clone should an item that's in Arc's backpack to fill the slot? It's just annoying that the hero can literally not use an item that can change what happens in a game, especially when the hero almost always can bring a game to late game.",DotA2

To give some timestamps as reference at 29:15 the dire find some remote mines stacked up in the middle of the dire safelane and Techies manages to detonate individually every mine that gets right clicked once, so before getting the second and killing blow, he is not even hovering over the mines or selecting them.

t3_m32547,Morphling Remodel Idea,"First reddit post btw...

Im making this post hoping others will also feel the same way about morphlings model. Even a more graphic enhanced and higher poly model will still feel outdated and old, hopefully they give him a complete visual rework like Viper and Slardar recieved. I found some cool images for ideas of how a visual rework could look... I will link the origin of the images[(link)](https://www.cgtrader.com/gallery/project/morphling) also to give credit to those who created them.

In all it would be nice for a visual remodel that makes morphling look more menacing and gives him almost a monstorus presence as compared to the puddle of water being rendered we have now. The serpent facial look of this model I personally like as it gives me nostalgic memories of the naga faction from Frozen Throne days. By no means an easy task I understand that however it would be intersting. I also saw a post where a suggestion was made that depending on whether he shifts agi or str his model will change such as the agi shift will make him more lean and almost snake like and the str shift will make him almost bulky.

t3_m36mtt,You should be picking mid Dark Seer this patch.,"Take it from me, somebody who can't play mid to save his life, mid DS is an easy win.

I'd say the closest comparison would be core Wisp, but harder to bully because you have good base stats (57 damage, melee hero damage block, and 5 armor) and a stronger early game damage spell.

There are a three reasons I think he's good right now.

1. You farm stupidly well. Shove in mid with Ion Shell, take the side camps, rinse and repeat. This holds true even in hard lanes (ie Invoker or Oracle dispelling Ion Shell the moment you enter lane) because you just farm the jungle really quickly the moment you hit 3. Mid DS takes advantage of this better than offlane DS because he can bounce between mid and the jungle, while offlane DS only retreats to the triangle when he's forced out of lane and even then can't take ancients without losing all his HP.
2. Because of Surge, you don't need boots for the early game. You can absolutely just go Null &gt; Bottle &gt; Midas, giving you insane income when combined with the already high farm speed from Ion Shell. This is particularly good, because...
3. The new/changed items in 7.28 are PERFECT for Dark Seer, giving you a ton of strong itemization routes.
 1. Witch Blade makes up for your bad Agility gain with its armor, and gives you an extra chunk of damage equal to 3x your int on a hero with 3.1 int gain that likes to buy int items.
 2. Your new Aghs scepter is insanely good. 100% uptime Ion Shells on your entire team, *and* they get +350 HP.
 3. Vanguard can now be disassembled. Situational, sure, but against a Lineup of Windranger, Lycan, and NP you can grab this and some mangos to fight early, and it won't even put you off your buildpath since you can disassemble the Vanguard to make an Eternal Shroud and Octarine later on.
 4. Memes aside, your Aghs Shard is one of the best. Pair with blink dagger for a 2.25 second stun that also knocks them into your team (potentially through a wall) without even putting Vacuum on CD. The Illusion and bonus damage are also nice, but not as important. If you opt for the Parallel wall talent, this lets you drop the wall on their face, then punch+vaccum to get them to the other wall even without the Vacuum AOE talent.
 5. Eternal Shroud provides mana, magic resist, health regen, and spell lifesteal. All of these things are good on Dark Seer, especially with how much Ion Shell damage you pump out with level 20 and Aghs.
 6. Silver Edge is now cheaper and gives 3 mana regen. Might sound weird, but it pairs great with Shard as an alternative to Blink. Similarly, Echo now gives more mana regen. Nice.
 7. Gleipnir is the perfect follow-up item for your Vacuum+Wall combo
 8. Refresher is buffed, so the double wall dream is now a bit better.
 9. Pipe is nerfed. Combine that with the existence of Eternal Shroud, and teams will be less likely to have that aura/teamwide shield hampering your Ion Shell DPS.
 10. Blink now has late-game extensions. Good news for a hero that farms as well as DS, and Arcane Blink is particularly good on you.",DotA2

t3_m30mq9,The amount of people who refuse to play the game they queued up for is at an all time high,"Every single game will have at least 1 to 2 people who just dont want to play dota 2. They will always fulfill at minimum 1 of these criteria:

1) Is role queueing and did not want the role they were given, so they choose to play another position in that position (IE, viper 3, carry in the offlane, support with no support items, carry in the midlane etc)

2) Wants to play one specific thing and will play it no matter how badly it fucks up your team comp and positions (IE, have an alch mid and they pick spectre carry or vice versa)

3) Absolutely refuse to pay any attention at all to the game happening around them (IE farming camps while the entire team got wiped 3 seconds away, not TPing for dives ever, farming when they arent a position to farm)

4) Absolutely refuse to itemize to what the game needs, only what they want (IE supports not building support items, not building dispels or survivability when they die alot)

5) Committing the same mistake over and over and over again and not attempting to learn/prevent it from happening again (IE, running to the same part of the map and dying, challenging the same person and dying, over and over again)

#All of this is griefing behavior.

This is *exactly* the same as buying amulet and sitting in a lane. You did things the game allows to do something you want that nobody else does.

These players signed up for dota 2 and just refuse to play it once in a game. Overwatch is a good step in the right direction but there is no report option for ""This player has been taking every camp as support the entire game and done no support duties"" and so they go unpunished and ruin more games for other players.

I wanted to make this post so new players know what they are getting into when they decide to start playing Dota. I also added some Feedback and suggestions.

# üî∏For other new players

**-Don't be scared when people say Dota is a difficult game.**

You can learn the mechanics pretty quickly and they are not as overwhelmed as you might think. Yes, it is a hard game, but the problem is not to learn all the mechanics etc. but to get good at them which takes a lot of time and practice.

**-Buy Dota+**

It sucks and shouldn't be a thing that features like pull timer in Dota are behind a paywall but it's pretty cheap so you should get it. It does not only help with a couple of helpful features but the stuff you can buy with Shards, a currency you get from quests are kinda cool too. A trial would be really cool tho. Like reward new players after 10 games or so with a free 3-day Dota+ trial.

**-Check guides on Gamerzclass**

Dota content creator scene seems to suck big time (sorry but compared to League its true). The only decent guides I've found were on Gamerzclass. They have a 4 days free trial which was enough for me to check out almost all guides. I'll probably also pay the $10 a month to watch them and the remaining guides and to support the site since they seem to put a lot of effort into it.

**-Spamming one or two Heroes that are fun helps a lot.**

Watch replays of that Hero to see how its played. [http://www.dota2protracker.com/](http://www.dota2protracker.com/) is a good site to find replays. Just search for the hero you like and click on the copy icon to copy the replay ID. Then go to Watch Tab in Dota &gt; Replays and paste the replay ID into the upper left search box. Do not overwhelm yourself by trying dozen of different Heroes.

**-Play support (but don't be scared to play core when you get the chance).**

You can always play other roles later but support seems to be the best role to learn the basics of the game. Also because most people you will meet will refuse to play support ""bEcAusE TheY aRe aLl 7k CoRes"" and rather go duo mid or ruin in another way than playing some role for peasants.

**-(Probably) Find friends to play with.**

I'm more of a solo player but finding people to play with is probably the best thing you can do. If you are a solo player like me and having a hard time unlocking ranked just listen to some audiobooks or podcasts in the background. It makes things a little bit worse and you don't have the feeling that you are wasting your time being frustrated.

**-Muting is your friend**

Always mute other toxic players. Even if they are not toxic towards you. I found myself arguing with others way too often instead of just muting them and concentrate on the game. This is only important if you enabled chat communications tho.

# üî∏General/Suggestions

**-About ""New Player experience""**

Not gonna lie. I don't think I've ever played a game that is so god damn awful for new players. And no it is not because there is no tutorial, there are plenty on Youtube. It is 100% the Matchmaking. I had 20 games and had to play with and against people with 2000 games. I had 5 games and played against Hero spammer with 100% winrate in 20 games. In 100 games i maybe had 5 decent ones that were fun and not completely frustrating. However, after unlocking ranked the smurfs seem to be gone and now i have normal players as teammates and opponents.

**-Current Ranked ""Season"" System is a total mess**

Seasons exist in every sport and also in pretty much all competitive Computer games. It is common that by the end of the season you get rewarded for your achievements, which does not seem to be in case in Dota. Dota is the only competitive game I've ever played that does not reward players by the end of a season or rather doesn't even have a proper ranked system at all. Everything feels so High-End compared to League so its hard for me to understand why the Ranked System feels like a placeholder in some Alpha Game.

**-New Players have all incoming chat muted by default, without knowing it.**

I know this is probably for the best, but in my first game i kept using the chat and was wondering why nobody answers. There was no notification like ""nobody can hear you"" and it took some time to realize that all incoming chat was simply muted. However, i still think new players should know that this option is enabled.

**-In-Game Group/Friend finder.**

I think Dota could really benefit from an In-Game Group finder. As i said the matchmaking is pretty much the only reason why people quit the game after just a couple of games. I'm sure there are enough chill people out there that wouldn't mind finding a new buddy and help them get into the game.

**-Add a free Reward System**

Free rewards are a good way to keep people motivated to keep going. Had 5 bad games in a row? Well, at least I'm only 2 games away from this nice courier skin. I'm sure that rewarding players would help a lot, especially new players. Like after every Dota Level you get something new up to level 30 or so.

# üî∏The Bad

**-Toxicity is on another level.**

Even with a 10k behavior score the toxicity in this game really is on another level. And this comes from someone that played LoL for 7+ years. Player didn't get their role? Goes Jungle, picks Pudge, Techies or whatever and goes into ""idc"" mode. Midplayer killed the other Midplayer? Pause. Midplayer gets ganked? All chats in caps and blames supports. Midplayer dies again? Shadow Amulet and ""go end"" in allchat.

Dota could really benefit from a system that auto-detects game ruiners. I had games where a player blocked all camps, went like 0/30, bought gem and wards and dropped them for the other team but you still have to play this game for like half an hour. In LoL these games will simply not count and are save to leave.

Racism also seems to be a big issue especially towards Russians and Arabic Players. I don't know how it it outside of EU Dota but Russians being called ""subhumans"" etc. is a daily thing I've experienced.

I can't say much about sexism. I didn't use my mic often and only when i had the feeling that i have chill teammates.

**-Matchmaking**

The team with the better smurfs wins. This has been my experience in my first 100+ hours. I almost never had close games, comebacks or whatever. One site always destroyed the other. Smurfing seem to be by far the biggest problem Dota has in almost every bracket and game mode.

**-Smurfers/Experienced players are not welcoming**

You could think that at least experienced players might help you out but they literally only communicate with you to call you trash or whatever. They don't answer your questions, they don't help, they just insult and flame you. A prime example is when i asked someone with 3000 games what items to buy a few times i got ignored. Then the same person insulted me for buying the wrong items.

**-BattlePass exclusive Items**

This is one of the biggest bummers for me and probably for every new future player as well. I will never get the WR Arcana, never the Shaker Arcana, never the QoP Arcana, never the Invoker Persona and so on. I understand that there has to be a reason for people to buy lots of Battle Pass Levels, but it really sucks when you ask where did you get this amazing skin and the answer is you can't anymore. Yes, exclusive skins exist in every game, but not with this quality and they usually come back after a year or so too.

# üî∏The Good

**-Client**

Dota probably has one of the best game clients I've seen on any game. It loads fast, has a lot of useful features and i did not witness any bugs yet where i had to restart the game (which is a common thing in the League client).

**-Cosmetic System**

In League all you see when you buy a skin is an artwork. In Dota you can not only preview the skins in the client but also check how they look like in-game. Mixing skins is also awesome. Getting a good-looking set is also super cheap. Like i bought skins for $2 that look better than $20 skins in League.

**-Watch Tab**

From the very start, it really amazed me how Valve outclasses Riot in terms of ""technology"". Even though Riot has thousands of employees dedicated to League alone. The Watch Tab is really great and it really helps a lot as a new player being able to watch high ranks and pros and learn from them.

**-Game is way more fun to watch**

If you have ever seen Worlds i feel sorry for you. Honestly i find Chess Matches more exciting than LoL Pro Games. They are so freaking boring it's almost depressing. Watching Dota however is really fun.

**-Good games are really fun, but too rare**

I mean this makes sense of course, but balanced games where both teams are equally skilled are super fun to play. Way more fun than in League. Especially when your team communicates all game and are super chill. These games remind me that i actually play with other people. I don't know how to explain it but in League, even though you play with and against real people, it sometimes doesn't feel like it. But voice communication brings these players ""to life"".

**-Players are more competitive**

I really don't like this ""iTs jUsT a VidEoGamE"" attitude. Even in unranked games people tried their best to win. Well, almost all except mid players that have mental breakdowns when someone takes their role.

That's it for now i guess. Sorry for bad english its not my first language.",DotA2

t3_m2khmt,History ?? AoS - Dota - OvH - DotaRemakes Wc3 Roc 1.23a,"Its 1.03 roc Not 1.23^

so there's a missing history lesson to the making of Dota2. 

back in the day there was a map maker Yodie.

He made a cs map holds the record for most map title changes for a cs map ever

because he made a clan club house map ztk\_hideout the ztk\_ part held the intro to the welcome screen when you joined the server, it said map belonged to this clan server connect to the clan server respect yodie. So people would remove the ztk tag, put their own clan tag in and host the map, private or public server clans would use this map.

map make Yodie makes a AoS style map in 1.03 RoC its the first map to compete with Euls for having as many custom heros to select from and has more features that Euls current map. The Map is being lobbied as Dota2 OvH or Orcs Vs Humans Dota. or OvH dota. 

This cam to people finding a map editor bug and being able to open Yodies OvH map individuals started to post and create multiple relabeled and remade map versions, blizzard had released a patch   
to try and fix any exploits but that patch was also timed well with the up and coming release of frozen thrown Wc3 was basically trying to make the old [battle.net](https://battle.net) boring so people will get frozen throne.

&amp;#x200B;

After the 1.06 patch Euls and Yodies map both broke with unplay able errors and spells with stuns that lasted for ever. This almost ended Euls, OvH map lobby take overs and than the 1.06 patch broke everything, Yodie had a final release in 1.03 and left his mark. Euls took ? a month or so to patch update his spells and map. further down the road Euls retired dota instead of porting to frozen thrown, probably because he saw yodie could do it someone else could do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So , tho Euls wasnt the only one who saw yodie's map was the first map to be able to harvest characters, spells and data from and port them into dota adding all those additional heros..

&amp;#x200B;

so if anyone has a Orcs vs Humans OvH map from 1.03 RoC you can see dazzle, treant protector, side shops secret shops. those maps are pretty rare as steam and valve removed them all.",DotA2

t3_m2win9,Try to have one No-Dota Day per Week,"This is by no means advice for everyone, but I noticed that a lot of people developed addiction problems during the lockdown.    

It's especially difficult with DotA, because you could rank up every day, learn so many new things every day and just not playing for a full day might feel like a big missed opportunity.  

Things could be tough because e.g. the Battlecup is Saturday evenings and everyone generally comes online after work, just when non-gamers would meet and socialise.  
Social isolation might become an actual thing.  
People might argue, that their best friends are in Dota, but imagine having a bad day with them, losing a few games in a row, going offline with everyone tilted and then having no one to talk with about that.  

Judging by my viewer-statistics on youtube, most dedicated Dota players are adults who have responsibilities and other things they need to take care of - things might be shoved aside when every opportunity is used to play Dota.  

Obviously, your mileage on how much time to strictly keep off of Dota may vary.  

I myself use this approach, having certain no-Dota days, to make sure that I'm not addicted and I don't neglect real life matters. It helped me a lot and it takes a lot of stress from everyday. The Dota games then feel even better and emotions(pma) are much better in check.",DotA2

t3_m28dtl,A Short Analysis on the Best Neutral Creep to Midas,"Have you ever wondered which creep you should use your 30 minute support ogre midas on? Well wonder no more, because I have done the maths!

I'll explain the process in brief, first I made a text file of every neutral creep (except ancients) and their respective gold and experience bounties. Now these values are a bit finicky as gold exists as a (usually) small range of values, and experience increases every 7.5 minutes. For the sake of simplicity, I took the average of the gold and the base experience. (The experience increase is 2% of base value for every creep, so they don't scale wildly differently if it were 2% of current value, so this post is still somewhat relevant).

Then I wrote up a small python code that spit out the following values: 
1. gold gained (which is midas gold-base gold) 
2. experience gained (2.1 * base exp) 
3. gold gained + experience gained
and some more because you may value one resource over the other
4. gold gained + experienced gained but with a 1.5x modifier on gold
5. same as above but 1.5x on experience instead
6. same as 4 but with the multiplier 2x
7. same as 5 but with the multiplier 2x

Now what I expected was that different weights of the resources would result in different creeps being the most valuable. But I was wrong!

It turns out, that for every situation except when you consider gold only where kobold is most value, and experience only where it is a tie between the best creep and a few others, the best creep is always the dark troll summoner! I went back to the wiki to make sure I didn't fudge any numbers, and sure enough, the dark troll summoner is tied for the most experience of any neutral, while being considerably lower in gold bounty to these other creeps.

So there you have it lads, if you want to midas a neutral creep, the dark troll summoner is the best choice.",DotA2

# Support Puck Guide

Puck is a ranged intelligence hero notorious for her ability to evade capture and cheat death on the regular, while disrupting her enemies with an array of spells. Puck is one of the most mobile heroes in all of Dota, having the ability to confuse her opponents with unpredictable moves.

Over the past few years, it (I thought Puck was a he, but apparently it is an ‚Äúit‚Äù?) had always been played as an initiating core, which is a position 2 or 3. Blink Dagger and Veil of Discord was the general go-to kit, so what happened for Puck to suddenly become so versatile in drafting it can be played in 4 positions (everything except carry)?

&gt;In fact, this ridiculous‚Ä¶ thing‚Ä¶ is now the most picked hero in Immortal bracket, with a 51% winrate. Having slightly over 50% winrate is acceptable, but being that while being the most picked hero probably means the hero is overpowered in a sense.

# Why is Puck so versatile now?

* The metagame is shifting itself towards a multi-core playstyle, where supports who are strong during laning but weak after are not preferred. (Think heroes like Silencer, Shadow Demon and even Grimstroke who‚Äôs been having terrible winrates lately without specific draft combos.)
* Supports also have the job of shoving waves now, compared to old metas where only cores do so.
* Position 3s sometimes have the potential to switch positions with the position 4, such as a Slardar position 3 might end up with lower farm than a position 4 Puck.
* Overall improvements in laning tactics. Back in the past, if you had a bad lane it means that you will have to be zoned under your tower and pray you can sap some EXP. Afterwards, having a bad lane means that you buy Iron Talon and go jungle. Now, if you have a bad lane, you either pull creeps or stack enemy creepwaves to force the creep equilibrium to be under your tower.
* This also means weaker laning matchups are much more tolerable, allowing a hero like Puck, who is a decent harasser with right-clicks but still pretty weak in lane due to having no hard disables to thrive even as a support.
* The laning phase‚Äôs advantages can also be negated by a few decent pickoffs or skirmishes, or a single big teamfight, which is why a hero like Puck can be useful as while it is pretty weak in lane, it is a great teamfighter. Dream Coil also has much lower cooldown than the likes of Reverse Polarity / Ravage, which allows Puck to be much more active in fights.

# Why Puck as a position 4 (or even 5)?

* Drafting advantages. You can firstpick a Puck and the enemy will have no idea what role you‚Äôre playing as.
* Constant teamfighting abilities. As mentioned above, Dream Coil has a much lower cooldown than stuffs like RP / Ravage / Black Hole etc, which means you can take more fights.
* Not that gold dependant (but works really well with gold) but only EXP dependant, as Puck‚Äôs abilities scale based on levels alone.
* Lane shoving abilities. Puck can shove deep lanes alone, then just Illusory Orb into trees and TP away. With this sense, Puck should be the one holding Observers to place deep wards.
* Transition abilities. Puck can switch into core gear with enough farm.
* Overall buffs to her abilities, especially since Waning Rift has a mini-blink now hence Puck‚Äôs reliance on Blink Dagger as initiation is slightly lower, especially during the early game where you don't have a Blink yet.

[The range on Waning Rift can actually be deceptively long, comparable to a Faceless Void's timewalk. The courier is the starting point for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/vq3q2x5xbdm61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e56e73c96957ca0a7127e380b52b550c05ec15cf)

* This hero is so ridiculously versatile you can build Daedalus on it and still make it work in some way.

# Early game (Laning phase):

Puck is not all that terrible in lane due to its ability to trade effectively in lane. Its rightclick damage is nothing to be scoffed at despite recent nerfs, and the attack animation and base attack speed are generally pretty well-rounded. The drawback is that Puck is pretty squishy (This thing has almost 0 armor level 1) , hence if you get chain-stunned by the likes of Rhasta + Wraith King your life is pretty much over.

However, Puck‚Äôs Illusory Orb and Phase Shift can both disjoint and dodge most incoming projectiles. The first thing you have to do the moment the game starts is to skill orb and orb out of the base so you can place deep offlane wards without getting spotted. All you want to be doing in the laning phase is trading as efficiently as possible and to ensure the enemy heroes‚Äô health is never healthy. If you aren‚Äôt able to do so or if somehow the enemy duo trades better than you, just fall back to the good old side camp pulling, disrupting enemy safelane pulls and stack enemy creepwaves then teleport back to your tier 1 tower to get EXP with your lane partner.

[if you're trading a lot against a ranged support, consider getting Phase Shift level 2 because Puck's base armor is a fucking joke. \(It was 0.8 level 1 with a single Ironwood Branch\)](https://preview.redd.it/tlt4kew5fdm61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed83bcd11a8bc46cd64c34422b566545ed00e6da)

# Mid-late game (Teamfights):

Puck‚Äôs game generally begins when you reach level 6 and have Dream Coil for pickoffs. Puck has massive AOE silence and powerful team fight abilities. By maxing out your Illusory Orb, you are able to provide long range nukes with minor sacrifices in mobility for damage. Maxing Waning Rift however provides more powerful AOE silence and damage, which works well in 2v2 laning phase. Puck Dream Coil is one of the **BEST** counters for heroes with escape abilities, think heroes like Ember, Storm, Void Spirit, Faceless Void etc.

Its mobility and disruptive abilities allow her to be an effective initiator, setting up kills for her team. Your job as a pos4 particularly as a Puck is to keep the lanes pushed out. If the lanes are pushed in, youre kind of penned into your own base which a Puck doesn‚Äôt want because it wants to be fighting constantly. Puck can clear waves easily with Q+W.

Pucks teamfight decision making looks simple on paper yet it does take lot of creativity and game sense to pull off as well. As we know that Puck become quite vulnerable during its spell downtimes. If you have Blink Dagger, you generally blink in, Waning Rift and Illusory Orb away while using Phase Shift to wait for the Illusory Orb travel time as harass. If you plan to actually initiate, just add Dream Coil into the mix. If you don‚Äôt see a good initiation window, just Orb out, wait for cooldowns, then do the same thing again. However, if you do not have Blink Dagger (likely if you went for a Spirit Vessel build, for example), you will have to Waning Rift into the teamfight (If you are at least above level 10, you probably would take the cast range talent. It gets even easier afterwards with the Waning Rift range and AoE talent / Aether Lens, if you plan on getting it), Orb + Phase Shift for escape as usual. The concept is very much the same, it‚Äôs just that having Blink makes things so much easier due to the range.

[Your job is to either initiate, or wait until you have the chance to prevent enemy escapes. A great Dream Coil for your team to follow up can turn the tides of a teamfight.](https://preview.redd.it/ixph5yi3cdm61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae6153290df3b5c4fc71408c9157f827b1abd906)

[After a good Dream Coil, your team can just come in to follow up with damage and kill everyone.](https://preview.redd.it/jqw1rfr0edm61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=322218157134abeebe5e848bafcfef46c1749422)

[In fact, did you know the original Million Dollar dream coil in TI1 by Dendi didn't include a Blink Dagger at this moment?](https://preview.redd.it/krggmxs6edm61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deab4e4b2757c5c5e9e48bb7f2d58fa897d7f003)

**Make sure you‚Äôre the one warding, and if you need to ask your buddy to buy wards and drop them to you.**

All of Puck‚Äôs abilities scale pretty well despite the damage not being very spectacular, Phase Shift is generally left alone till the mid to late game due to the fact that most of her damage comes from Q and W. So typically Q is maxed out first, as it is the longest range nuked and thus the safest. W is given second priority, as it does require a closer distance to her enemies compare to Q. Dream Coil, on the other hand, should be taken at every opportunity in order to maximize its stun duration and damage. Bear in mind this skill build is very situational, there are a lot of situations too where you can max W first, especially if your lane partner is someone with a disable for you to follow up with.

Recommended skill build : Q W Q W Q R Q E(optional) W W E R

Alternative skill build: Q W W Q/E W R W

^(\*\*phase shift is situational as to dodge projectiles such as VS‚Äôs stun \*\*)

# Itemization:

**Core items:**

Urn / Vessel (optional) &gt; Boots of Speed &gt; Wand &gt; Blink Dagger &gt; Scepter

**Situational selections:**

Eul‚Äôs Scepter, Aether Lens, Force Staff, Veil of Discord, Aghanim‚Äôs Shard

**Item descriptions:**

* As Puck is very active in fights, Urn is great because you‚Äôll be collecting a lot of charges. It also provides Mana regeneration, something a Puck appreciates. Spirit Vessel though is optional, get it only if you need it against heroes like Morphling, Alchemist etc.
* Blink Dagger should be your go-to item in most games for obvious reasons. It allows Puck to Blink in, W+Q+E+Q as harass, rinse and repeat. It also allows Puck to initiate with Dream Coil, too. Bear in mind with max level Phase Shift, Puck with a Dagger is nigh unkillable without ground-targeted disables such as Jakiro‚Äôs Ice Path or AoE DPS spells such as Dark Seer‚Äôs Ion Shell.
* Eul‚Äôs Scepter is generally considered against roots and silences.
* Aghanim‚Äôs Scepter is a great mid-late game pickup against Juggernaut, Lifestealer or just general BKB carriers. (Who doesn‚Äôt buy BKB on their carry nowadays?)
* Veil of Discord is extremely optional, but is a good item to consider against illusion spammers like Phantom Lancer and Terrorblade, so you can clear illusions better with it.

t3_m2dqzj,PMA mentality in new players,"Today something happened that had years without witnessing in dota. I usually play in the US East, I live in a Spanish-speaking country that is closer to that server, even more than Peru and other servers in Latin America, and I play there because I have better ping, I have been playing an alternate account of mine to practice heroes for my main account, since I don't want to spoil my mmr even more. I have more than 10 years playing dota in a casual way, however I was left alone since my current friends prefer to play LoL and I only played that with them and for them, and my old friends who played dota were in places to play lan parties, and I never heard from them anymore.

In my game, there was a lycan who apparently did not know what to do or how to play the game, he only said ""I'll go wolves, calm down guys, this is in the bag""

As usual in these games, it was a clown party, leaving aside that we had 2 hc and the lycan was trying to farm jungle I was a tiny off, who had to go to pos 4 because my dragon knight also wanted to farm, and then the True, I did not die because I already knew that we would lose due to the clear advantage of the enemy and I dedicated myself to farming in the dead lines and the jungle, the lycan was level 4, while the enemies were 10, I was 8 or 9, however the he had an excessively positive and not ironic attitude, ""guys we can win"", ""let's get together and win""

""We only need to fight 5"", ""as a team if we beat them"", I knew we were going to lose, and in fact that was what happened, but he never gave up, he went 0/9 and I always thought we could defend and win.

His mentality was so incredibly positive, and it was not ironic, he really thought he could.  


It may be a silly way of thinking, for some but to have so much PMA, maybe out of innocence or who knows, but maybe there is still hope for new players, obviously he must improve his notion of the game, but at least the winning mind, it already has it.",DotA2

t3_m2nnvq,Overwatch reports with people abandoning.,"I just wanted to know community opinion on this subject, as far as I know abandoning games will get you to LP regardless of reports, if you have a high BH (Behavior Score) you can dodge it with a big cost on that, but its not immunity, second strike in a short time is LP for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, there should be countless motives someone abandon a game, which I can't judge as a stranger watching someone else.

I got a report that someone was AFK in fountain with anti-game and got abandoned, clip is short but overall carry was farming normally, teleported fountain out of nowhere and that is basically it.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal opinion on this is that, something happened, he had to leave, the abandon itself will be a sludge in his behavior score and he even might go to LP aligned with a couple reports if he screws or even abandon other games, so I voted not enough evidence and moved on, but it got me thinking later.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR; 

I thought about other types of reports of this kind that could happen, someone who plainly **disconnects and abandons due to rage-quit** or no **apparently reason**, or **someone who leaves after someone else abandons** and got reported for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I feel that a person can't be blamed if they don't want to be in a flawed match, but I want more opinions on this take.

t3_m2mwcr,An Overwatch case I found challenging,"Safe lane Slark [reported for feeding](https://gyazo.com/249716d29d58300779af871979dc57b0) in a Legend game (his account is Ancient rank).

Match ID: [https://www.opendota.com/matches/5879814828](https://www.opendota.com/matches/5879814828)

**Problem 1:** The enemy team has an Ursa who is very clearly a smurf. He dove their fountain and got a rampage 25 minutes into the game when none of the tier 2 towers had been destroyed and ended the game 26/0/5. His profile is also hidden.

**Problem 2:** The Slark was not intentionally feeding. He didn't destroy items, walk into the enemy, or any such behaviour. Every death looked like an attempt on his part to get a kill, albeit a really bad one.

**Problem 3:** Looking at his account, it seems very likely hat he's been boosted. Its a pretty old account, created in 2012, with long breaks of several years. Its possible its his old account he started playing on again, but he has multiple days of 10-1,6-1,5-1 streaks to then go 1-1 on most other days and 0-3 recently.

**Problem 4:** Overwatch does NOT specify reporting a player for matchmaking abuse like being boosted or buying accounts. That was added as a [post-game report](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m1dkbl/you_now_have_extended_options_for_reporting/). However, if his account was boosted, that itself can be seen as an act of griefing by ruining the experience for other players.

**Problem 5:** The Slark player has an [anime avatar](https://gyazo.com/f9e40b49484044dc73642387d70b0d4d) with the profile name ""Suck my loli dick"", which feels like enough of a reason to convict them ^((just kidding)).

1. Don't tilt. Can be tough for some people.But learn not to tilt,every time you die or make mistake focus on what you did wrong and try to improve.
2. Don't flame your teammates. ALL people make mistakes,even rank 1 players miss spells,comboes etc. Don't ping on them,stay positive!
3. Every game si winnable.This may sound stupid,but in my experience it's true.I won couple of games where dotaplus said enemy team has 95%+ win chance.I won games where enemies had 40 000 networth lead. Try to play as team, pick off enemies on map and try your best.
4. DON'T FEED. You will waste time of others and yourself + mmr of all other people.
5. Try to learn as many heroes as possible. Playing as certain hero will show you  his weaknesses, tricks which you can use to counter him in next game + it's good to have larger hero pool so you can counter enemies better.
6. Take break after you lost game. You just lost ranked, you're upset. Don't go next game.Take break,stand up,walk around in house, excercise, don't play next game right after losing. 
7. Last tip,most important.Have fun.

t3_m2ohh7,Is this griefing? The problem with the new Overwatch system.,"I just played a game with a pos4 Doom who literally didnt buy items til he finished a naked radiance. The only other item he had was a wind lace. We laned against Pa and Lion and he didnt even buy a magic stick. I reported him multiple times during the match and I assume so did anyone else on my team, although we thankfully kept the tilting about this guy to a minimum and just played. The problem is that, with the old report system, this guy would eat 4 reports and if he does that a few more times hell be in low behaviour score games permanently. With the new system, theres a good chance someone will watch this and say ""mAyBe HeS jUsT bAd, hEs oNlY 3K, i DoNt EvEn KnOw wHaT tHiS MeDaL iS"" and the guy gets away with it. Which would explain the shit Ive seen in my games in the last few weeks. 

The problem with Overwatch is, that it only hits the dumbest of the dumb. If youre a griefer and youre stupid enough to break your items, well congratz, youll get punished. But its so easy to grief in a way that can, theoretically, look like the player is just really bad and clueless.   


I feel one partial fix for this would be to make teamchat visible. A few weeks ago I had a game with a faceless void who was really bad. We were still winning the game, even though this guy was malding nonstop. And then our rubick took 2 cs from him. So void basically said something along the lines of ""im not buying bkb unless rubick says sorry for taking my farm"". Rubick told him to eat a dick and so void just pushed down lanes blind, took shitty fights all alone in the opponents jungle and died to a luna scepter eclipse every time he used chrono. Meanwhile he was while taunting us and talking about how we deserve to lose etc The usual. Making teamchat visible obviously wouldnt stop void from doing this. But to me it seems people act like this cause it gives them power over their teammates and a way to punish those who \*wronged\* them. And taking away someones ability to taunt his teammates with shit like this would take most of the fun out of it, cause people would just think the player is really bad. 

Another possible solution would be a  to have some double evaluation system. I think its a good change that reports get checked by players now, since most reports that people see in Overwatch are in fact bullshit. But If someone gets reported by multiple people over and over and overwatch judges always find him to be innocent, theres a good chance that somethings going on that the overwatch system isnt capable of catching. 

The quality of my games has nosedived so hard in the last weeks. People give up won games for the most petty shit and just stop playing. 3 out of my 5 losses yesterday were due to people tilting and refusing to play.  They know theyre immune and wont get punished as long as theyre not dumb enough to break their items or feed down mid. 10k behaviour score is completly meaningless now, everyone but the dumbest of the dumb has 10k behaviour score now and it shows. I dont know if theres a better solution for this but at this point Id just take the old system back.",DotA2

It told me to press space to center the camera on my hero. Space centers the camera on a random spot on the map.

I play a mode which claims to guide you through how to play in a bot match. The entire match, I never notice anything remotely like a guide.

Is Valve in the game business to make money? This is ridiculous. I'd go install LoL if it wasn't owned by soulless MBA frat boys and the CCP. I'm left with HoTS, which is nice, I guess.

t3_m2gq4u,Role queue farmers should not be given a free pass to troll games,"One of the most frustrating things other than smurfs, account buyers and boosters are role queue farmers.

I'm talking players who have finished their role queue tickets and are now queueing all roles to farm tokens. More often than not, I see these players picking garbage like pos 5 pudge or some off meta picks like offlane techies, pos 5 am etc. I'm not against off meta picks, but if you do pick those you better have a damn good reason to back it up and actually try to win the game.

The problem is players farming queue tokens treat these games as a mandatory ""get it over and done with"" game and clearly don't give a fuck about winning, because who cares? They still get the tokens win or lose.

My suggestion: Make it so that if you get reported by 3 people in your team for not playing your role, if your team loses, you do not get any role queue tokens. If you team wins, you still get 4. This will encourage people to still play the game properly even though they are not in their preferred role.

t3_m2iih5,More efficient overwatch suggestion/Discussion on if someone should be guilty or not,"If Valve ever reads this (They probably won't). Something that would make the whole overwatch thing slightly more efficient is if there are 2 people who are obviously griefing/feeding to be able to guilty both. I just finished watching a game where there was a Sniper in ranked who picked the role support and then proceeded to try to take middle from the invoker (who I am assuming picked the role middle) and all game only buy brown boots and TP scrolls. then the invoker proceeded to spend the rest of the game invisible and buying a Shadow Amulet and then staying invis in the mid lane so they don't abandon well the rest of the team (aside from the before mentioned Sniper) tried their best to win. 

Now to be fair I don't know for sure if I did get a case for invoker if I would say they are guilty but it got me thinking about what if there are 2 people obviously feeding down mid but I only get the case for one of them. Wouldn't it be better rather then assign the same game to 2 or maybe even 3 different people why not let one person decide for the whole game?

&amp;#x200B;

Side note would you consider the invoker to be griefing in this scenario?

t3_m1eelh,A modern guide to DOTA 2 cheats and how to spot them (Overwatch Case Files),"Some friends and I have been pooling overwatch cases to collectively review and between us we've had 4-5 hacking/scripting games over the past 2 weeks in our pool of cases. 

I've seen some outdated information from streamers doing overwatch on what cheaters look like. The hallmarks they're looking for seem to be ""the player does not click on the enemy heroes when casting spells"". 

In our experience we have seen new hacking technology that seems to take control of mouse movement in order to execute combos, quickly hex etc. These hacks can be a bit more subtle to spot and I don't see a way in which they'd be caught in game by an opponent in the many cases. Of course, an observer watching the player perspective of the cheater could spot the strange behaviour. 

In this post I'd like to go over some of the cases we've spotted, detail the primary cheats that we can see being used and note some behaviours that should allow for them to be picked out better when you see them in the wild. 

### The Cheats
##### Magnetic Mouse (+Auto Cast) 
As soon as the cheater's mouse moves near enemy units it snaps to them, this allows for precision uses of hex/orchid etc in hectic situations and also when trying to disable a juking target in the trees. Whether the abilities are cast automatically or just very quickly by a human player I can't be 100% sure of. Given the otherwise low skill level of mechanical execution by some of these players I suspect that the casts are automated based on what the script sees the enemy health as. This could function as an auto last hit tool in lane as well from what I have seen. 

*How to spot it:* The cursor will snap and hold onto targets while combos of abilities are being cast. The user often avoids putting their mouse near enemy units when they do not want to cast spells because they want to avoid their cursor being dragged away, this leads to a bit of a strange movement where the user is trying to walk their hero into a place to fight while avoiding units until the fight breaks out. I call it ""walking the dog"". 


##### Maphack
It seems like modern maphacks are dependent on server updates about unit death and unit creation. Cheaters are seemingly unaware of enemy hero movements but can hunt down a farming hero based on which creep camps are dying without map vision. Hackers are also always aware of where techies mines have been created (see the skywrath game). Presumably wards are also easy to spot so some hackers will hold sentries for the free money. 

*How to spot it:* Easiest to spot in techies games as the user has an uncanny ability to find all the mine spots and farm up the free bounty gold. Otherwise this more limited maphack only seems recognisable when used for hunting farming cores and dewarding. 

##### Auto Micro
Seen in the Arc Warden and NP games this cheat automatically controls units. In the case of furion it issues automatic attack move commands to every treant you create (individually!) it also seems to be linked to automatically casting sprout before nature's call. If you are viewing player perspective this cheat is blindingly obvious as it steals camera control briefly to issue orders to the unit. It seems to use accelerated mouse panning rather than camera coordinate snaps to get there which looks really odd in replay as the camera just flies about the map faster than the eye can see. In the case of arc warden the tempest double plays itself completely automatically; it uses items, attacks enemies, uses skills on enemy heroes etc. 

*How to spot it:* This is very easy to spot from player perspective as their camera movements are very eratic, flying back and forth between units issuing random commands. The cheat program seems to use the attack move command almost exclusively for the micro units so these players have abnormally high attack move orders on opendota etc. The user often seems to be fighting the cheat program for control of the camera when trying to runaway with their main hero while their units fight/farm, it's pretty funny to watch although I think it would give me a migraine. 


### The Cases
##### Match ID: 5864060366 Arc Warden 
This is a use of the auto micro script with copious use of auto casting and weird magnetic mouse movement. Watch for any time the arc warden uses their tempest double and how their mouse/camera behave. 

**Standout moments:** The fights at 27:45 and 30:45 where our cowardly cheater tries to runaway while his tempest double bravely holds the ground and keeps using spells. In the 30:45 fight the player gets run down while desperately trying to get away as his camera is constantly stolen from him by the program.  

##### Match ID: 5868723404 Nature's Prophet
This is a very obvious use of the auto micro script with copious use of auto casting and weird magnetic mouse movement. Watch for anytime NP uses nature's call and the way in which updated orders are pushed to his treants. Mouse movement is chaotic. 

**Standout moments:** The whole game really. But try 20:00 or 26:40 for examples. 

##### Match ID: 5871251902 Skywrath Mage
This is a case of magnetic mouse movement, auto casting and map hacks. Watch for how his mouse always sticks to enemy creeps, enemy heroes etc. Note also how he dewards and kills techies mines. He doesn't use his ulti till he gets atos, presumably because his scripted combo relies on atos+silence+ulti. 

**Standout moments:** Laning stage the magnetic mouse movements are very clear. First gank where he uses his combo is at 17:45, note how his mouse kind of wobbles up and down snapping to the target, like a fish hook. Combo on the MK at 22:00, same movement. Kill on the tinker at 30:00. For some map hack action: Sky pings mines in trees at 13:50, goes to demine them, gets punished. Sky pings a cluster of mines at 41:00, jakiro goes to demine them with his face and dies at 41:30 ish. I said he was hacking, not that he was good. 

From the translated chat log this guy actually admits to the hacking, saying they didn't help. :( 

##### Match ID: 5867212252 Skywrath Mage (again)
This is another case of magnetic mouse movement, auto casting and map hacks. Watch for how his mouse always sticks to enemy creeps, enemy heroes etc. This guy also barely ever has his camera on his hero so maybe that old zoom out hack is still around? 

**Standout moments:** In the rune fight watch how his camera snaps between heroes frantically (when he is actually watching his hero anyway...). When he gets his atos at 18:50 and TPs to kill AM watch his mouse movements. 21:55 when he combos the Magnus. 24:00 when he picks up the haste rune to kill tinker.


The players from the first 3 cases haven't played since the day their cases were reviewed. The offenders in case 2 and 3 both have older VAC bans on record. The Skywrath player from the last game is still playing and has over 500 Skywrath games on record. I'm not sure how overwatch handles these cases, perhaps they apply a kind of triple redundant voting to help avoid convicting innocent players. 

I would say in many cases these hacks give a fairly negligeable advantage (the auto micro looks like it could cripple a good player). But the basic auto casting and magnetic mouse movement hacks seem advantageous for some heroes. Hopefully by viewing these cases you'll be able to spot the signs of cheaters in your own cases, and by understanding how these cases work hopefully Valve can stamp them out in the near future.

Editting to add a case from today's haul:

##### Match ID: 5877254896 Zeus
This is another case of magnetic mouse movement, auto casting and what seems to be some kind of low health snapping tool. When enemies are in Dire Vision and have health low enough for Zeus to kill with his ult or nimbus his vision will snap there. It does this even when those abilities are on cooldown leading to his vision ping ponging. 

**Standout moments:** Instant euls on LC at 38:15. I see the mouse moving towards the LC and back at 0.25X speed but it never even gets there meaning the whole mouse movement and cast must happen between server ticks. Inventory merry go round at 42:15 (look at his items). Insta Hex on LC at 47:45. Camera constantly snapping to low HP SK at 50:35 (He actually dies fighting his camera because of this).",DotA2

t3_m2fru2,What is going on overall with Dota 2?,"Dota 2 feels like a bizarre combination of keeping it alive with many employees working on it and not giving a flying F on quality of life.  I understand that Valve as a company has a very loose policy on how people do their work but I feel like there should be SOME designation for certain things to maintain their games. DOTA 2 has a lot of attention and users as it is, in its low upkeep state. I'd like to imagine it would completely outshine its competition and keep more players engaged if they invested more. Many aspects of the service need to be polished. Couriers leveling up through the ground where they died, dota plus offering very little (treasure sets looked like normal heroes without anything special this time), special effects being seen through fog of war so you can see where enemies are, long spaces between special events, their official forum, and arcade mode. 

With arcade mode I just had a party of 4 friends decide we wanted to play a 4 player arcade mode. I hit play and it immediately queued us and started the game and then canceled it because someone was not done downloading. All of us cannot play arcade for 60 minutes. We cannot create a custom lobby with a password for only us 4 to play in. There is no indicator that not readying up results in a ban. There used to be but now there is not. I guess its for all games now (?). We all said that sucks and logged off dota for the night because we werent going to wait an hour to play.

The forums are also a joke and always have been. The website looks like it was made in 2002 and has about 20 people looking at posts and 0 replies to any of them anywhere.  

I've been playing dota since W3 and I've watched it evolve over my life to something awesome where so many people of all ages could join in the fun that was my high school years on a massive scale where people make a living doing it. I've never played League but I've seen it enough to know that it FEELS like many people put a lot of effort into making it smooth and beautiful. Each hero skin is unique and offers a lot of value to it compared to just throwing on a neat armor thats somewhat different on some parts of the hero. 

It has always felt like Valve half never truly cared about the game and always left many quality of life things on the backburner. I know they have and many people have put a lot of hard work into the game to keep it alive and keep it relevant with updates/balances and I appreciate them. It just always has felt like they could use a few extra hands to bring it up to that next level. If they really expect to move forward with an anime to draw in a bunch of new players but things look half assed they will not retain as many as they think.",DotA2

Then during the final racks push from the enemy team, he finally shows up to help in base. Enemy safelane tower STILL STANDING at this point.

If you have people willing to volunteer to coach new players and a way for new players to request for a coach and someone from the community can answer that request, it can do wonders. 

You can literally have a coached custom game among 10 players to help them learn the ins and outs of the game and better understand the complexity. And coaches can help tailor the training to help new players. 

Tldr:
Dota has a coaching system setup, why not use it in the next few weeks and advertise it. Make it easier for people to request for a coach and allow coaches to pick up the request.

t3_m0suug,I am retiring from Dota 2 Wiki. Here's what that means for the community.,"I'm Lemon, head admin of [Dota 2 Wiki](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki). For the last 9 years, I've been keeping the wiki updated (with much help from /u/Bu3nyy and others). But I haven't played Dota for many years now, and simply don't have time to keep doing this. So I'm retiring.

Luckily, over the last few years Buny has taken over game mechanics updates, while I still update the hats, events, lore, TI, and generally anything that's not gameplay mechanics. So after I leave, **the cosmetics database will stop being updated**. Pages for events like [Aghanim's Labyrinth](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Aghanim%27s_Labyrinth) will no longer be made, at least not by me. 

Buny has said he will keep updating game mechanics for the time being, so don't worry if you only care about hero balance changes. But if anyone wants to help with the other stuff, read on:

#The Cosmetics Database

The [cosmetics database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Cosmetic_Item) is currently 100% up to date (12,294 articles). I've made a page for every single hat and HUD item in the game, except for a few temporary event items. All hats have previews in the form of videos, gifs, or screenshots. All significant customizations (effects, animations, icons, sounds, styles) have been checked and listed on the wiki.

This has taken well over 1000 hours over the years, even with a Python script. Arcanas and complicated treasures can take 3~4 hours, even with my familiar routine/setup. Each summer's TI cosmetics take up to 100 hours. Because of the time needed, I don't really expect anyone to keep updating the hat database. And tbh, no one else has really shown an interest in doing it since the game came out. 

If you want to try and update it, just look at any similar page and copy the templates, then fill in each parameter. General information on every item is found in items_game.txt (the schema). To find the full customizations list for making tables, check the schema &amp; the file in Dota Workshop Tools (the in-game displays are sometimes incomplete or incorrect). Icons and sounds are extracted from .pak files. Basic knowledge of Mediawiki markup is nice. Exact spelling of everything is required or things will break. Use the source editor, visual edits suck.

Programs I use: 

* ValveResourceViewer to extract game files (schema, icons, etc)
* Dota Workshop Tools to check custom animations lists &amp; capture some effects/models  
* Notepad++ to parse patch notes/mass find &amp; replace
* OBS Studio to record videos
* Adobe After Effects &amp; Premiere to edit/crop videos
* Photoshop for animated gifs/screenies

#Event Pages
Event pages like [The International](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_International_10_Battle_Pass), [Diretide](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Diretide_2020) or [The Underhollow](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/The_Underhollow) are not hard to make, they just require time and good organization of information. I try to use as many tables as possible, new headings whenever necessary, and short sentences in point form so things are understandable at a glance.

If you make a page for a future event, don't write long rambling paragraphs that nobody will read. Extract icons from game files so it doesn't look like a wall of plain text, then arrange as much info in tables as you can.

#The Lore Database

The [lore database](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Lore) has about 650 articles, and represents maybe 10% of Dota 2's lore. The idea was to make a wiki page for every character, god, place, species, artifact, concept -- every tiny little thing that's mentioned even once in hero biographies, hat flavor text, comics, trailers, event lore, Underlords, Artifact, etc. This was a HUGE fantasy project and I basically gave up after a few hundred hours.

I've gone over most of the older hero bios/voice lines/item flavor texts, but never started on the comics, Underlords cards, let alone the upcoming anime. Adding references after every sentence and writing the same info on multiple related pages turned to be super tedious, so I don't expect people to do it that seriously (but it would be nice).

#Goodbye
It's been a great 9 years with the Dota 2 community, and I've had many tense 90-min matches where I really had to go pee but couldn't let down my team so I just used an old yogurt bucket under my bed while waiting to respawn. There was also much in-game flaming over my unorthodox jungle Sniper strategy (uwu). But that's okay, I forgive you all &lt;3

/u/Bu3nyy is now the head admin in charge of Dota 2 Wiki. I've transferred everything over to him. Please direct all future complaints to the Bunbun.

Thanks everybody. Goodbye.

Edit: Thanks for the appreciation everyone! If anyone wants to donate a few bucks to me, there's a link on the wiki's [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/dota2wiki). I am really poor and will use it for dental work ;_;

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for all the recognition &amp; gold &amp; donations everybody! It's really gonna help me out. I'm going to bed now, so goodnight and thanks again to all, and I hope the best for the future of the Dota 2 community.",DotA2

I know a griefer wont be punished,"Overwatch has been a boon for identifying the very obvious cases of feeding and griefing but it has lot of problem that is rarely discussed here. Previous system allowed use to report the griefing and the number of reports was  the judge. It was assumed that toxic played would get more number of reports and punished.

&amp;#x200B;

But due to nature of overwatch and lack of chat the griefing and feeding that is very obvious in game but impossible to decipher in overwatch are effectively immune from persecution.

&amp;#x200B;

I have faced in my last game. We were ahead at 30 mins against techies. Then my core silencer randomly lost his mind coz my other core was farming a camp and gave up on game. he was randomly walking  in lane hitting creep till enemy came and killed him, unpausing  our own's team dc and telling use . We didnt lose rax and defended for like 30 more mins. our rest 4 players were trying. I did report him but i know nothing i marked him for ever  be validated by the reviewer. He didnt destroy  his item, he didnt block his camp, he just gave up and told us he is teaching our other core lesson. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just had an Overwatch Review Case. It was a Crystal Maiden reported 3 times for feeding. Almost everyone in that team was dying. Yeah sure, squishy Crystal Maiden may have fed 2-3 kills to Invoker first but they all kept dying...

Because the Invoker was 99.9% smurfing. It was a STOMP and the Invoker was the reason. Knew what he was doing, knew when to kill, knew where to go, super fast with spells. Guardian? Hell no. 

I voted Not Guilty on the case. Technically, Crystal Maiden was feeding (dying a lot and even being near the enemies as lvl 5 when they are 5-7 levels higher) I still hold on to my opinion.

Meanwhile, a lot of interactions between related old heroes are still not there. Like Anti Mage and Undying. Or Silencer and Chen.

The reason why Dota is so toxic sometimes is because players have to invest their time in a game while only half of those players are win and actually feel like their investment was worth their time. Valve really needs to bring back level progression chests again but actually make the chests worth it (immortal level items or even past exclusives that can‚Äôt be traded or sold). Give players an incentive to actually play this game after being berated by the toxic mess most players have to encounter each game. I know most of you will say ‚Äúyou should only play Dota to play Dota‚Äù and while I agree for the most part, why would anyone want to play Dota if there‚Äôs a 50% chance I will lose, wasted investment, and also willingly get into a game knowing the players believe it‚Äôs my fault we‚Äôre losing this game.

* Radiance deals damage regardless of whether or not you are stunned, controlled, or kited. You must hit something for battlefury to deal damage. Unlike antimage, riki, or PA alchemist has no built in way to get 'on top' of a target, meaning it's more difficult to put him in a position where is constantly hitting his target and benefiting from battlefury.

* Alchemist does not benefit from the increased regen provided by battlefury. Building a soul ring is enough to ensure he can consistently cast his spells and chemical rage takes care of hp regen.

Easy solution, no need overwatch, smurfs can go away faster. When a certain number of smurfs report has been identified the account will automatically be detected as smurfs and get 100-200 mmr or whatever mmr the smurf detection gives.

* **Jetpack (Clockwerk):** *A prototype modified for the Clockwerk armor. Rattletrap is not quite adept at aerial maneuvers, however.*

* **Tidal Wave (Kunkka):** *The waves borne from the incident with the Cataract were said to awash clean entire shores.*

* **Horn Toss (Magnus):** *This technique only Magnus could achieve amongst his kin: to lift poachers with the horn before the goring begins.*

* **Hammer of Purity (Omniknight):**  *A simple holy rite of the Wingfell Hammer Purist holds causes both wielder and enemy to have their faith in the Omniscience tested.*

* **Gobble Up/Spit Out (Snapfire):** *""He don't bite. Much.""* / *""Fire in the hole!""*

* **Sleeping Dart (Riki):** *A strong soporific agent within this dart can knock out even the wiriest of targets.*

* **Fish Bait (Slark):** *A rare treat within Dark Reef loved by many, including Slark. He finds more enjoyment in ravenously procuring it back from the ""thief"" that he plants it onto.*

* **Concussive Grenade (Sniper):** *Close up targets are not only dangerous, but hard to aim at through a scope, and Kardel would rather keep the scope.*

* **Terror Wave/Demon Zeal (Terrorblade):** *Behold that which even demons fear.* / *Terrorblade's cockiness in battle leads him to initiate a minor demonic pact with himself.*

* **Ink Over (Grimstroke):** *Through sinister irony, Grimstroke mimics his near deathly transformation from the black ink onto an unlucky participant.*

At first it only happened late at night so I didn't really think much of it but now even in the afternoon it's most likely to happen. For the record I am currently sitting at 9,950 behavior score and 3430 MMR.

Have I been placed in sort of a shadow pool? Is the playerbase in this skill bracket this low that the matchmaking has no solutions but place people together regardless of their behavior score? I don't really know. Yet it makes me concerned about the state of the game üòì

t3_m189w6,Question from a returning player regarding last year's Arcanas.,"So I recently came back to DotA 2 after being fed up of the increasing toxicity that plagues League of Legends right now, and I've been having a blast with Dota once again.  
  
That being said, in one of my games I stumbled upon an insane Queen of Pain skin (my exact words at that time were, ""Holy shit she looks like one of those Instagram ""influencers"" LOL!"") and so naturally, I checked the shop to see if it's purchasable and sadly to my surprise, it is not. :(  
  
Then I stumbled upon [this list of Arcanas](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Arcana) on the Dota 2 wiki and I realized most of them *are* purchasable except some of the more recent ones. I was wondering if they'll release them in the shop some time in the future or if these Arcanas will be permanently unavailable moving forward? I would really, *really* love to get that QoP Arcana and maybe even the Windranger one, since I enjoy playing both of those heroes and these skins look really sick.  
  
I tried looking for this information elsewhere on the net but I can't really seem to find anything other than guides from July 2020 talking about the Battle Pass where these Arcanas made their premieres. So any info on this would be appreciated, love y'all and have a nice day! &lt;3",DotA2

And since the Dota anime is close we really have to embrace the newcomers.

Since there will be many accounts that reach the ""roof"" it would also make the system easier to match them together, smurfs play against smurfs? Doesn't it sound good?

Fuck this game, seriously I've had enough of this bull shit one sided games. It's frustrating when they put you into a lossing bracket. All my 12 games been nothing but my offlane and mid being trashed constantly. While my support sits by the tower and only comes out when his spell are off cool down and then goes back mia. While I'm taking all the damage and the the enemy team pulls the creeps and at the same time I have hard support rotating bot to gank me. Mean while my offlane is fucking shit, my mid lane is 0-3 into 5 minutes. Like come the fuck on, I understand you get 1 or 2 games like that, but fucking 20 + games in a row. Mean while my behavior score fluctuate from 9500-10000. How the fuck am I spouse to enjoy this game when every game my whole team getting fucking trashed.

Midas + phase into 10 minutes fucking great. No hp, no stats, guess what happens next ? He gets fucking trashed. Anyways the weather is finally getting better and I'm glad I'll be putting a end to this shit game. 

I also wouldn't be surprised that the xp and gold you getting is also rigged. I've had games where my team get trashed 4-26. I'm playing against pa that is 16-3, clearly dominating our team, me as a jugg I ended up getting a kill on him, I get 350 gold? Like wtf ? While I'm 3 lvl behind him and my net worth no where near as his. 2 minutes later their mid (morph) that is also dominating, gets a kill on me, get fucking 850 gold and 600 for our 1-6 sf. Seriously.

The scepter is insanely strong, and there are really not many counterplay options at all, because the whole point of the scepter is to counter one of its counters (bkb).

Puck blinks in, presses one button and 2-3 heroes are just almost guaranteed stuck there for 8 seconds.

Puck has the potential to do so much other cooler stuff but she can't be buffed or changed in other ways because majority of her power in the late game is in that upgraded dreamcoil, it's kinda sad. Instead of a flashy, cheeky hero that pops in and out disrupting and annoying enemies, you get this one-trick dreamcoil pony that presses one button and her job in teamfights is 3/4 done.

Not to mention an aghs upgrade that basically removes one of its counters and then adds some numbers is really boring.

t3_m1k3gb,Why I no longer enjoy dota 2,"One of the main reasons I stopped playing for about 5 months after the 2020 bp ended (playing since 2013) was the matchmaking behavior I noticed. The game somehow finds a way to force my winrate to hover around 50%. If I win too much I started getting the literal trash/toxic players of dota in my team and the godlike smurfs and tryhards in the enemy team. Every game I win above the 50% winrate seems like a struggle and an uphill fight until I eventually reach the point where the pressure is too much and I just roll back into a losing streak until I am at or below 50% win rate, at which point matches become easier and I swing back up again.

Whats wrong with that you say? That means that I will never play rank because there is no point, and even when I play normal I feel like the outcome is out of my control, even if I struggle to win, I'll just lose the next game. Its very frustrating and off-putting. If the game is really designed to be this way then the design sucks balls. It feels like there is no way out. Many of my friends are just as frustrated as I am, and I know several people who spent thousands of dollars on cosmetics and played for seven or more years quitting dota for good, which further pushes me away from the game, since I can no longer enjoy the game with my friends. 

Tldr: I am a long-time dota player who is tired of the 50% forced-winrate matchmaking system, frustrated to the point while I no longer enjoy the game, nor wish to play it. How does one deal with this problem?

t3_m0rjkm,Local Dota 2. Florida.,"Hey everyone! I used to post here years ago, we had a fairly large Dota 2 scene in Florida (although it was rather spread out) but I just wanted to make another post and see if it's still lively. I used to host monthly events at a LAN Center down here and I ended up hosting a $1000 Dota 2 tournament in 2013.  


Last  year I was able to achieve a dream of mine and open a Luxury LAN Center in Florida. We had planned to be open in December of 2019, launching with dual $1000 tournaments in Smash and TFT, but were delayed due to permits and zoning issues. We were delayed until March 2020, which you can probably see where this is going.  


We did our 2 week soft opening free play time... then April everything closed for COVID-19. We opened back up in May of 2020, with masks, hand sanitized everywhere, spacing people apart, etc. We're in the process of still recovering from this, and having little resources for marketing.  


If anyone in Florida is interested, I've posted some pictures of the facility down below. I'd love to have at least a monthly Dota 2 event, if not a weekly event going on.

But I got reported way too much, my behavior score dropped just because people tilt easily, so I stopped playing him. After seeing Kuroky pick MK hard support in the DPC last week I decided to give it a go one more time. Now, I'm no Kuroky, I'm a mere low divine player, but I had some success playing MK as hard support and this guide is dedicated to people who want to try something unusual. Without further adieu, let's start:

*PROS and CONS of picking Monkey King pos 5*

**Pros**:

1. He has a stun. A 22 second cd one, but a stun nevertheless. With a 1200 range, correct me if I'm mistaken, but that's the highest range stun in the game, with Invoker's cold snap taking the 2nd place with the range of 1000. I'm talking about basic abilities, of course, Ravage has 1250 range.
2. He has a ""slow"". An 80% slow with the max duration of 4 seconds. Add an Orb of venom in the equation and it gets much higher. You can use this to effectively gank mid or offlane, you can easily get on top of the enemy mid, that's something no other conventional pos 5 can do.
3. He can clear waves easily with level 4 Primal spring. Later in the game, you can easily cut waves using this ability.
4. His ultimate is a decent zoning ability. You will lack the damage as a pos 5, but you can at least reduce the movement speed and armor with Orb of corrosion.
5. He is a great scout/smoke breaker/ward placer. Being mobile is what makes MK an excellent support. You can easily put the wards on enemy cliffs, their triangle or behind mid t1 tower which I often do before we start pushing mid. With level 10 Tree dance vision talent, he is ideal for scouting the high ground while your team is right behind you.
6. He can zone almost every melee offlaner in the lane. Players have it engraved in their brains that every time they see a Jingu counter over their head reach 3, they back off, because they don't want to give extra damage to Monkey King. You can use this psychological advantage to zone the offlaner while giving your carry free farm. If you manage to proc Jingu, you can use it to heal which is also useful.
7. Being considered primarily as a core hero, the enemy team will automatically focus on Monkey King when given the chance. I had a game where I was warding the enemy jungle, then Puck started chasing me, used Coil to stop me, spent almost entire mana pool, killed me, but my Storm zipped in, killed Puck and finished his Orchid after which he snowballed hard.
8. Picking him as hard support will confuse the enemy. When they see Monkey king and PA both in safelane, they will be confused. I also play some mind games on them, like I will type in all chat ""report PA for picking pos 5, go end, I'm afk"" which will lower their guard and suddenly we kill them because they think we are griefing. Trust me, this thing works.

**Cons**:

1. He has only 1 disable on a 22 sec cooldown. For example, when maxed, Lion's stun has 2,6 sec duration on a 12 sec cd, you can basically stun people 3x longer than MK for the same cooldown period. Not to mention popular heroes like Lion or Shadow Shaman have another disable spell, which makes them far more useful.
2. His ultimate is a decent zoning ability, but kinda useless. The enemy team can simply walk out of the Wukong rings, and compared to the ultimates of Lich, Shadow Shaman, Lion, Lina, Wukong's command is really bad.
3. He can't boost his carry in any way. All of his skills are offensive, and if the enemy offlane duo is stronger than you, they can simply crush your carry and there is nothing you can do. Warlock, Treant and Oracle provide heal, Lich provides a shield that reduces incoming damage, Abadon has hard dispel, you can only use your level 1 stun for 0,7 seconds and you will most probably miss it, coz it's a skillshot.
4. Your team will tilt super hard for picking him. In like 90% of my games, whether they were ranked or unranked, people started flaming me just coz of my pick. I've had offlaners who go 0/6 in 10 minutes then type ""gg, report MK pos 5"" even though I won the lane for my carry. No matter how good or bad you play the hero, you will ALWAYS be a scapegoat for the rest of the team if you are losing.Mid QoP dies in enemy jungle because he went solo and there are no wards? Report MK of course, why didn't he ward!!!Offlane Nature's prophet teleports to enemy base to kill a courier and dies? ""GG, Monkey king support, account buyer noob, report him pls""Carry Void uses chrono on illusion? ""9 reports for MK pls, yes, I know he gave me free farm and I'm 13/1 because of him, but I made a mistake and it's all his fault""

*GAMEPLAY*

**Early game**: I start with 2 sets of tangos, a salve and Orb of venom. I go offlane to attempt first blood. I put a point in Tree dance and put ward in the enemy jungle. You can easily get first blood on enemy pos 5 if you land your Primal spring. After that I tp to safe lane or stay top to go for another kill. In safe lane I will try to maintain lane equlibrium by Tree dancing to the big camp and block spawns. If the lane is easy I will go super aggressive and even die to the enemy just so my carry can get the kills. If we play defensive, I try to pull and block the big camp. Around 5 min mark I make sure to get both runes and put a ward on the cliff to scout mid. With level 3 you can easily gank mid and get a kill. My first 2 items in this period of game will be Tranquil boots and Orb of corrosion.

**Mid game**: If we play agressive, I put deep wards as much as possible and scout the enemy jungle for potential ganks on the enemy carry. If we play defensive, I will push out the waves with Primal spring and be an annoyance for the enemy team. Many times I've stopped the enemy core from TPing to a tower my team is pushing with a stun from a tree. My first bigger item will be Eul's scepter. I use it for mana regen, to set up the Primal spring or as a dispel. You can use it inside the Wukong's command when the enemy focuses you.

**Late game**: Since I have no damage and my spells don't pierce bkb, I go full utility build. I buy Vlads, Glimmer, Crimson, Pipe, whatever aura my team needs me. If we are stomping the game, I go for Basher, not sure if it works with Wukong's command soldiers, though. In this period of game, people are 6-slotted, noone carries wards, dusts and it's my job to provide vision for my team and break enemy smokes. I always jump on the trees and put a ward behind the rax before we push highground. I once stopped Earthshaker from using Echo Slam on my team just because I Eul-ed him from outside the fountain.

If you have any more questions or suggestions, feel free to write in the comments. You can also say how dumb this is. Now I know there are people who pick pos 5 core and farm the entire game but I honestly believe almost any hero can be played as a support if done properly. And I think MK is definitely one of them.",DotA2

t3_m14dil,Suggestion: Sticky a Post with resources for new players,"Valve has done the impossible: New players are trying DotA2!

r/dota2 is the second fastest growing gaming subreddit right now. Chances are that most of the newcomers joined because of the Anime, and thus have no idea how to play DotA or MOBAs in general. 

While there is a button for new players on the sidebar, it is not very visible when using RES and disabling subreddit style. Moreso, at least in my experience, the first thing that I notice in a new subreddit are the stickied posts. 

Therefore I suggest to either sticky a link to to existing wiki article, or creating a new post with some updated info on learning the game (e.g. the Discord communities, the project SirActionSlacks is working on, ...) for the purpose of new player retention.",DotA2

t3_m13kx9,Is throwing a game by standing at the enemy fountain punishable?,"I believe when you're about to win and instead of wrapping up the game you decide to sit outside the fountain and kill enemy heroes that you should be punished. Not because it's mean to do it or anything like that, but because you're actively going against the objective of the game: destroying the enemy teams' ancient.

I say this after having a 70 minute game yesterday in which we barely clinched victory... or we would have if all 4 members of my team weren't BMing outside of the enemy teams fountain trying to score kills. They all died to a sniper and they pushed back and we lost.

I am sitting helplessly as a WD support spam pinging the towers because the game has went on for so long and victory was never assured given how close the score had been for the entire game. I think we need a consensus on what constitutes throwing a game or griefing, because firstly it's just bad manners to sit outside a fountain and refuse to end the game and if it all goes wrong then you all just look like massive egotistical fools who threw a win for the sake of getting to spam easy in the chat.

I'd like to hear the communities opinion on this, and was wondering if these issues are as prevalent the higher up in MMR you climb (I am Herald 4 at 500MMR). I personally believe these cases are griefing/throwing the game as the objective isn't to kill as many people as you can, it's to end the game by destroying the ancient.

I understand that I can mute people, but that deprives me of potentially vital information, especially from teammates.

t3_m03x5v,Cheats that disable every player apart from the cheater to give ingame inputs,"MATCH ID: 5873927690

Some timestamps of cheating happening 3:10, 5:20, 8:17, 29:44, 29:55, 34:27, 36:47, 45:38, 48:16, 50:00.

Hey, I want to share this game and experience with you guys, so we can raise some awareness on an absolutely game ruining cheat, that I had to waste a game to today. So: I played a game with few friends of mine today. We played on radiant and the early game was a stomp, the russian enemies on dire (ancient ranked) seemed quite terrible and their mechanical skills and game sense was close of that to a guardian/herald.

However at around 7-minute mark, something fishy started to happen, without any packet loss or ping, all of our team was suddenly unable to give any ingame inputs such as move, attack or use spells, the enemy team seemed to have largely have the same issue. This lasted for \~5seconds and after that the game went on normally, we could move and attack without issues. Weird.

These weird broken moments started to happen frequently, however they always seemed to happen in situations that heavily favored our russian enemy team, especially their ursa player. The ""lag-outs"" happened for example when someone in our team was briefly being attacked by a tower, then BAM, no-one was able to move, attack or use spells, and the player under tower just had to watch while the tower killed them. OR when we wiped the entire enemy team, then the game suddenly broke again, without anyone of us being able to do anything until the enemy team respawned. During these lag-outs few players of the enemy team were still able to give some inputs like change targets, use items and spells, even though quite poorly and with delays, while our team was mostly unable to do anything and completely at the mercy of the last input we put. The enemy team also had a quite right click heavy team, that favored this type of gameplay where you could pretty much only right click and the lagouts happened frequently in teamfights too.

We quickly realized that the russians of enemy team were cheaters, there was no way these lag-outs that always favored the enemy team, were not a product of a cheat/scripts of some sort. We itemized to only rightclick and didnt build any active items, since spells and item usage was impossible. We managed to take down 5/6 of their raxes even though they had this crazy advantage, however going high ground was still almost impossible, because the enemy team could give their right click inputs and spells from the high-ground, freeze the game, use some items and spells, while we could not do jack shit. The enemy team managed to end the game by getting into our base, and just clicking our towers down with some creeps, while we were completely lagged out at the fountain.

And of course, the enemy cheaters flamed in all chat the entire game in russian and sometimes in english. What a shitty way to waste 50minutes of my saturday evening. We decided to wait for 10minutes before we went into a new game, and what do you know: the same russian cheaters from the last game: Ursa, sniper and pudge on the enemy team. I decided to dodge the game and take an abandon.

I have no idea how common this cheat is, but I never ever want to deal with it again and really hope that Valve can learn to detect and deter this cheat and ban the players who took part in using these cheats.",DotA2

The issue is not that people gain progress at half rate in turbo mode (which is intended), the issue is that many (if not most, it seems to vary on hero to hero basis) relics are not progressing *at all* in turbo mode.",DotA2
t3_m0vvqo,"Valve, can we have Phantom Rush be an auto cast ability?","PL has always had the same quality of life issue for years now, his passive is hard to use in lane because you can't turn it off while it's on cooldown, also you have to turn it on to use it of course. If PL's Phantom Rush was an auto cast ability, you could turn it on or off at any time and even have more control by using it manually.",DotA2
t3_m0po6a,Public Service Announcement.... Smurfing is a REAL PROBLEM,"Ive sunk around 2200 hours in dota and i started playing ranked pretty early as i was very young when i started playing. Im around 1k mmr and smurfing is insane, this makes me thing about new players coming and specially after the netflix series airs. Ive never seen Valve address anything about smurfs so i wonder how smurfs are going to be dealt with. the fact that there will be a lot of new platers means that there are going to be a lot of smurfs to shit on those new players even more than the smurfs that there are now. This is my piece of mind i dont need anyone telling me to get gud or something im speaking as a member of the community that loves the game and sees it slowly dying becuase of this.",DotA2

t3_m0uvcx,PSA Changing your associated number,"Attention Dota players,

If you are changing your number on your Dota account, whatever you do, DONT put in your old number by accident. I know muscle memory and having the same number for half your life (3) can sometimes cause you to absently and, without due diligence, fill out forms wrong.

I made this mistake, and now I'm on a cooldown of 3 months.

This post is not a complaint, nor is it a cry for change. It is merely a warning to those who are about to swap numbers. Steam support CANNOT change the number associated with your Dota account if you trigger this cooldown.

See you in 3 months",DotA2

After a mediocre laning stage he tries to join us in fights with like boots and ring of health and whatnot and blinks to attack enemies and dies .
I noticed him trying to farm lanes but enemy got some dagger initiaters and they killed him again .
Some russian started cursing him on mic and it was at this moment that he told us he is new and so I told him just not to play antimage . 
He apologized and said he was sorry for making us lose the game but I really felt bad for him cause it was not all his fault and we were gonna lose anyway . Maybe the game should tell new players not to play these extremely farm dependant heros ?
And yes he never finished his battlefury.",DotA2
t3_m0n3ne,PentAce Hype,"Really hyped on this team right now. Moo is playing great as pos 5. I didn't keep track of if he has been always drafting through the BTS, but they have had some great picks.

Moo's Kepper of the Light and Enchantress have been great. Sneyking is playing like a man possessed on the Tidehunter. 

I think this gels ready well with Fear and Ryoya being win conditions in the mid to late game.

Most of their wins feel like they have it locked down by the 30 min mark.

I am still a herald player so I haven't been able to feel out how Zfreak is but he felt like the most quality player to pick up from simply TOOBASED.

Unforunately they don't play a game for the next few days, but Latam Defenders should be a great top of the group match-up on the 10th.

If any of the Penta Ace players see this thread... good luck guys, great start so far!",DotA2

t3_m14x8t,Legalized dodging as solution to smurfing.,"The idea was raised by one popular Russian youtuber and the more I think about it the more I like it.

As part of the base game show enemy and teammate statistics before the game. Add an option to tentatively accept. If four(three? five?) of the players accept tentatively the game is canceled.
You have a 15 wins streak on tinker? Bad news, your queue time is one hour now. You spam pudge support? Wait 15 more minutes. Players with more enjoyable for others playstyle and playing at their real MMR get slightly slower queues on average. People who ruin the fun for others can ruin less games in given time window.",DotA2

For example, in my last game; I picked Tidehunter and then someone else in my team picked Troll Warlord and went to my lane. In another game, I picked CK and somebody in my team picked Morph.

I've also gotten a prettly low CS in the laning phase because of this due to both of me and the other player trying to get the creeps (farm getting) divided) while the enemy carry is leveling and farming a bit faster. What do you usually do when you are in these kinds of situations? Thanks.",DotA2

I left the game due to very toxic behavior because I myself do not usually play against or in LP so the most diplomatic way was to just leave instead of watching my team feed and be toxic. I have only received a 24 hr chat ban 2-3 times when I started playing Dota.

I have more commends than matches played ( although this might not mean anything to anyone else) this for me shows that I was always a positive player and helped my teams. This account is very dear to me since I have put in more than 3.5k hrs into it and a lot of money. 

&amp;#x200B;

It has been almost 3 years now since my account has gotten banned, I understand that my behavior wasn't good and that I shouldn't have left the game, however, please note I did not get banned for feeding, cheating nor griefing. Just abandoning a toxic atmosphere I did not want to be a part of nor did I want to fuel it.
