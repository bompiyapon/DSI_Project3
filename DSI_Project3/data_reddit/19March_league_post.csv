t3_m8id1l,Akali is now top 10 highest win rate champions in ARAM sitting at ≈ 54%,"In case you didn't know Akali had +15% more damage dealt and receive -15% damage in ARAM and recently in patch 11.6 it was buffed to +20% -20% on top of the global changes that she already got.

I was playing Taliyah yesterday and lost [1/3 of my HP bar](https://i.imgur.com/HT3CHOM.png) from one Q at level 8 which eventually lead her into [getting a Quadra kill](https://i.imgur.com/3EnxCEI.png) and before someone ask, i didn't get hit by the Ezreal ulti, i died soon after and Ezreal didn't get an assist. Also worth mentioning Taliyah debuff is only deal 5% more damage and i always bring MR runes. 

I later checked Akali's win rate on [U.GG](https://u.gg/lol/aram-tier-list?rank=overall) &amp; [LoLalytics](https://lolalytics.com/lol/tierlist/aram/) &amp; [OP.GG](https://euw.op.gg/aram/statistics) and she's sitting around 54-55% win rate now, previously 44%. 

With the champion already being obnoxious and these debuffs on top, you really can't do shit against her, she's perma invisible and kills you while taking reduced damage from you, she takes even less if you're champion has a negative debuff. Good luck revealing her with the snowball if it seems easy for you because in worse case she just Zhonya's or dash away.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8ivjr,With so many emotes in the game by now: Could the Emote Wheel be bigger soon?,"Maybe extend it by four additional directions: North-West, North-East, South-East, and South-West. If implemented well, it should still be fast and snappy, without being overwhelming.

For emotes, there are always some classics that I never want to switch out, and having to manage with only five at a time is pretty hard imo. 138 emotes in the game currently? How many more does it take to prompt some innovation? Most other games that are out there and that I have personally tested usually feature (emote/quick selection) wheels with up to 12 or more selections.

Now let's assume that the event is two part and she will come with the next half there's still nothing in the patch before that teases the champion like other champions have had in the past like fiddle, lillia, samira, etc and these next 3 champs are supposed to be part of an event that spans the whole year iirc.

There should be teasers each patch or lore or tidbits to let us learn about the champs without revealing them.

Assuming that Isolde is the new champ, which seems highly likely, but we can assume this due to the initial teaser and the little lore hear and there that mentions her.

I feel it would be more interactive if we learned about the champs as the year goes on or even have more teasers than we get normally which are usually once we are close to the last one initially teased.

I also think it was messed up to hype us about the new champs appearence then leave us hanging once the event skins were shown at least tease something more.

t3_m7t72z,Viego is the embodiment of what drives mages off from mid lane,"Viego perfectly encapsulates the current gameplay philosophy of Riot: he is manaless, has sustain (or has access to it through runes/items), his kit fixes his supposed problems (he should be a melee champ, yet he has 650 range spammable Q, getting harassed in lane due to his melee nature is fixed by his inbuult sustain).

 Add all these stuff up and you get a mana-less, sustained early game bully, who can endlessly shove wave after wave, forcing the mage to spend their mana, or just force trades to burn their mana even faster because he can just heal it back. And even if the mage survives all this until Chapter/Tear, Viego can just 100 to 0 them after 6, especially now that Seekers is garbage.
 Aaaaaand then Viego can choose to either be a splitpush menace or snowball a teamfights through his invulnerability and grasshopper execute ult.

t3_m8lgp5,Marksman items are too abusable on melee Champs,"Particularly Shieldbow. 

You nerf all fighter and bruiser items like Triforce to obscurity and now most champs that would take it just build Shieldbow. Why wouldn't you? Scaling HP and bonus AD, life-steal, attack speed, MORE THAN DOUBLE the damage of Triforce and a passive that gives you a shield and more AD when it activates. Not to mention the crit is nice too. 

Hell, Shieldbow has become a better fighter item than Triforce at this point while only ONE ADC uses it consistently. Every other user is a melee champion like Irelia or GP. 

You would think some bruisers like Fiora would want Triforce over Stridebreaker. You'd think Viego would like Triforce; but no. It's easier to abuse the stats of a marksman item like Kraken Slayer over a dogshit item that costs 63 gold less and gives less than half the AD of the other options. 

Fighter items need to be buffed and some of these marksman items need to become ranged only OR they need to get changed to a point where it's more beneficial for marksman.",leagueoflegends
t3_m876wt,How I imagine buying a skin should look like,"One of the main things you should see when buying a skin is the splash, instead of the exact same thumbnail (and a bit smaller too) and some text saying ""Pick up a new look for *X* !""

When browsing in the shop for skins, the steps you need to follow just to have a look at the splash are:

1. Click the thumbnail in the store.
2. Click ""Learn more"", it takes you to the champion profile.
3. Click on ""Skins""
4. Then search for the skin because the default position is the base skin

All of that to just see the splash of the skin you're buying, aaand if you're interested in the text that accompanies each skin, you won't see it this way, you have to go to Collection and then Skins for that text to show.

So I believe this way of showing the splash, which I don't think it's complicated at all, should improve the buying experience.

t3_m8uk5b,Help me without yelling,"Here I am.  A new player for a couple weeks.  I have played AI battles over and over.  Now I am trying to get in some PVP matches to really proctice and get better.  If it is important, I have mostly been playing Wukong and Ashe.

I honestly thought that I would get grouped in PVP with people the same lvl as me intending to play with others with similar experience and maybe even skill.  Nope, here I am getting yelled at every game to do something totally different than what I was getting yelled at to do the last game.

I'm not good, I know that.  How am I supposed to get better if I can't just play and try level up.  If I don't try to get champ kills, I'm wrong.  If I don't fight the enemy champs so I don't feed them, I'm still wrong.  This game is fun but the other players on my teams are so frustrating.  I don't get why I am grouped with people who know everything and have been playing for years.  I don't want a million pings near my location telling me the enemy is missing when clearly he is beating my face in so, definitely not missing...

**GunPangMan** Top Lane Challenger - 895LP (irelia, sett, akali)  
**JustLikeThat** Jungle Challenger Streame,Ex Pro  885 LP - (leesin, graves, nidalee)  
**Junbard** \- Jungler Challenger Streamer ( Karthus, lillia, graves)  
**Deokdam** (ADC, pro lol nongshim redforce)  
**Untara** \- Ex Griffin, Top Laner  
**khan**: famous challenger. random comments here and there

Who is the best player you met in soloQ in korean serve 2020? and the who's the worst teammate?

**GunPang Man**

T: Zeus (T1)  
J: Oner (T1). He plays pool with his lee sin angles  
M: Pnpm  
B: Deokdam, I always feel like I get carried when he's on my team  
S: I don't know much about the tools  
W: Happy Game. Whenever he plays, jungle lives in the bot lane. Mid can't push b/c there is no vision

**JunBard**

T : ZEUS, I won with him in our team a lot.  
J: Of course DWG Canyon. Other jungles are same-same but I can't win against Canyon  
M: for my play style?  Pnpm. Because in order for game to go the way I want...Laner must stay alive.  He never dies. he plays ""optimally""  
B: purely on SoloQ rec? Viper (EG)  he does everything on his own. and Aiming (BLG)  
S: I can't really...think of anyone. Especially this season  (Beryl was good though)  
W: JunFan (everybody laughs) (The fiora dude?) and he cuss on teddy's stream and of course happy game and K Chen (another fiora)

**Deokdam**  
T: Saechaepo (often considered #1 poppy) (everybody comments, he's line management ..) once he holds poppy, you can't win lane against him and zeus  
J:  there is this karthus jungler...zyb.(yeah he duals with Ucal). When he's on the other side, I don't feel like playing. Besides him...Canyon. Alright first of all, when he plays nidalee. His spear comes in a curved line!!!!  
M; Showmaker, or Clozer. When clozer chooses irelia. He can 1 v 3.  
B: Viper. You can't win. I don't know how but...he's level 1 and has a 2x attack speed. and Aiming. he's about 1.5 attack speed.  
S: Life and Beryl ( you like hook support). First Beryl's pantheon.(DWG Support) He plays on his own 1v2 as support.  And Life's Sett (GEN G). His sett's haymaker true damage zone is the whole zone. He never misses.  
W: Iwandy (everybody screams!!! that MF!!). When he plays janna, he never stays more than 3 minutes in a lane. 15 minute game he's at top 13 minutes. And ""as open"" you ping him 3 times, he afk.

**T1 Oner**

T: the zeus kid, he's academy kid so I don't really know. (jkjk) Kiin. When he plays Camille, he's hook shot reaches 2 meters. You can never dodge  
J: no doubt its tarzan but also...Z RyeoKOR. Especially his graves. He comes in level 2, I get hit 3 times and I die. (isn't he ok as long he doesn't use ignite?) He always use ignite. (lol)  
M: ZZorap (Zoe's challenger, known for his creative plays)  
B: Viper and Prince (livv Sandbox aka ""iris""). Especially Viper.  
S; i'm not sure, but in the early phase SwordArt  
W: happy game (khan: that guy is ahole). I don't …..necessary hate, but he plays champ that makes jungle hard to play

**Untara**

T: usually it was hard to play against chinese jax . But there are so many ID's so..(Untara is camille) and Kingen (JAX player),  
J: Tarzan for SoloQ. When I get ganked, i feel like its all my fault (khan: thats because its ur fault stupid!lol)  
M: Ucal's Orianna  
B: Viper for sure...and probably Aiming  
S: i dun....really. I just assume it as ""bot"" group not individual  
W: happy game. When he's playing we gotta save teleport. And smooth Grave. He's like the happy game for jungler.  


Any advice to climb from Bronze 4 to bronze 3 would be appreciated.   
see u then\~

* A group stage, where you play a Best-of-2 every saturday (starting at March 27) against another team.
* A playoffs stage, where you battle it out for the prize!
* (some) Prize money!
* Sign-ups cost €5 per TEAM in the lower division and €10 per TEAM in the upper division.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are interested, please take a look at the [website](https://esportsdelft.nl/calendar_events/120) of the DSEA.

Thank you for reading and have a nice day!

Even though the other semi is still to be played tomorrow, this also locks in Cream Real Betis as the third representative for the spanish Superliga. This is due to them sending the two finalists (to groupstage) as well as the best regular season team that isn't in the finals (to playins). BTS will either qualify by beating G2Arctic and being in the finals, or if they lose the series they will qualify to playins as the 3rd  place regular season team, since G2Arctic and UCAM, who finished first and second respectively, are in the finals.

t3_m8tv5p,What is up with the early surrender culture in low elo?,"Hi,

Don't surrender early on, there's so much chance that games can be turned later.

Like I see litterally many players in lane who 0/3 and start complaining about wanting to surrender. They think feeding 0/3 is the end and want to throw the game, so they can start a new one.

Unless it's a full on feed fest where everyone's 0/5, there shouldn't be any reason to surrender.

I just want to play and make the best use of my time, but it's so tiring to see people throwing games early on.

I want to know why this is so present, so I can learn to cope with this . And yes, this post is also a small rant, so people know.

t3_m8wdd6,Soraka since pre-season has been left in an absolute awful feeling state to play - issues with grievous wounds.,"There were two big changes in pre-season

- Grievous wounds now at 60% on ignite 
- New grievous wounds items including components, letting every class get grievous wounds at 60% eventually when the opted into it.

These have even been buffed further since then after issues with goredrinker, rune sustain and other pre-season changes which upped healing across the board.

Where does this leave Soraka? Soraka does not use any new items very well (will get onto moonstone) and now faces a new league of legends where everyone is already buying grievous wounds items every game because they are strong, and the fact it completely shuts her out of the game is a bonus.

If you pick Soraka in diamond+, the adc will rush exe calling, the support will have ignite and you will probably also be facing a moonstone + chemtech combo making sure everyone constantly has 60% grievous wounds at important points in the game.

Soraka only functions ""ok"" in elos where people just refuse to use these items, which has kept her win rate at decent points (although low enough to receive two large buffs).

But worst of all it is how this situation feels to play vs as a soraka player, even if they keep shoving her numbers up to keep her technically balanced. Your game is not reliant on how well you play, it is entirely based on are your opponents greedy and refuse to buy items to completely shut you out of the game.

Grievous wounds are so strong now at 60% and easily accessible that the ""healer"" class just does not work. Soraka is as based around healing as adcs are based around consistent damage, yes she has utility with slows and her silence, but the core gameplay is ""anti-dps"" healing  which has just been destroyed. Imagine if in pre-season tabis got buffed to 50% auto attack damage reduction, then champions got buffed so their win rate rates are balanced. This would still feel awful to play an aa based champion because your game would be entirely dependant on if the enemy bought tabis.

Do not confuse wanting the mechanics of the game reversed (Or soraka given in-kit answers such as grievous cleanse on q-w combos) for just wanting buffs, I have never complained when soraka has been weak (sub 47 win rate in some metas) before, because you could still make the champion work with your own skill. I just want to play my favorite champion without it being a reportable pick in high elo.

And finally, **Moonstone Renewer** , screw this item. Why would anyone ever play Soraka when they can play Zilean and heal pretty much the same amount every game anyway given the enemy might not rush grievous wounds for it.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7udjh,New champion idea: John,"Every new champion release, we get a bit more disappointed. We got Viego, the ruined simp, Sera-whatever, Rell?(Who was this again?).

We need someone more interesting, someone more unique, someone with a lovable attitude.

&amp;#x200B;

So hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

We need John, the Business Major

&amp;#x200B;

Lore: John is a business major from Piltover. He currently works as a secretary and accountant for the Targonian aspects after getting abducted by Zoe because she had been charged with tax evasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Release skin: Battlecast John

John is Viktor's second in command. He manages the building of the battlecast army. He has some doubts about Viktor's ideals, but at least he still has a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Passive: Hi I'm John

Friendly guy in the workplace, you don't know why, but you can't help but like him. John takes 20% less damage from all sources.

At the beginning of the game, John will get able to invest in stocks. Stocks 1 would be health, 2 would be mana, 3 would be gold. He can only hold a certain stock at a time, and he must sell his stocks in order to get different ones. 

Killing or participating in a kill would increase the value of your stocks while dying will decrease the value of your stocks. 

(John doesn't have to invest in stocks at the start. There is no time limit on your stocks, but if your stocks go negative, you will get negative stats. Less health/mana/gold debt respectively. These stocks can stack infinitely positive, but only a certain amount negative.)

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Funny guy

CD: 15/14/13/12/11

John makes a clever remark, channeling for 3.5 seconds. If John completes the channel, any unit within earshot (excluding neutral monsters) will be charmed for 2 seconds. Any champion hit will decrease the ability by 1 second.

(Channel time decreases with levels)

(Range increases with levels)

&amp;#x200B;

W: Clumsy guy 

CD: 8 at all levels

John accidentally spills some coffee on the floor, applying a root for 0.25 seconds, slowing for 50%, and deals 25 true damage on splash and 5 true damage per second every second they are in the spill. The spill lasts for 5 seconds.

(Spill duration increases with levels)

(Damage increases by levels)

&amp;#x200B;

E: Smiley guy 

CD: 40/35/30/25/20

John smiles his bright, white smile for 10 seconds, blinding and charming everyone in front of him. After 10 seconds, he shines even brighter, knocking champions into the air. If John affects a champion then it will decrease the ability by 50%. John's movespeed is 50% until he decides to stop.	

(Blinding and charm duration increases by level).

(This is similar to a Cassiopeia ult. Except it's constant.)

&amp;#x200B;

R: Inflation

CD: 240/180/120

Passive: At 6, every item's cost will be proportionally equal to one random country's inflation rate, decreasing the value of gold as the game goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

Active: John manipulates the market and makes every item on the enemy's shop 30% more expensive for 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

t3_m8904o,Rell's W knockup has clarity issues that make her harder to play against,"The knockup duration on Rell W is 1 second, but the CCed character is on the ground for almost half of the duration. Here is a clip of her W on a target dummy.

https://gyazo.com/25b909f3dc7b23d4c732bc7502b22375

This makes it extremely hard to play against as it looks like you should be able to get out of the follow up CC but you cannot. This can also cause cleanse and QSS to be wasted to try to flash out. All other knockups that I know of visually match their duration (rakan, alistar, cho, etc.)

Edit: you cannot waste QSS during the knockup after the recent item update",leagueoflegends
t3_m8qi8a,The new item mechanics worry me. When will we able to buy stuns?,"I am legitimately scared about future item changes with more problematic abilities at this point. 

* A while ago, Protobelt introduced the concept of buyable mobility, now even expanded to Galeforce, Stridebreaker and Prowler's. The dashes might be small, but they exist and can be used to dodge skillshots or close gaps.

* Duskblade allows us to buy stealth. (And it's fricking unbalanced, if you ask me.)

* Everfrost is buyable hard CC - something I never expected we would **ever** get in League.

This is just Season 11. And even if you do not consider these changes to be unhealthy, keep in mind that Riot usually steps forward more often than they step back. In the next season, if it continues like this, we might get an item with a point and click-root. In S13, a stun. In S14... maybe a Dagger that gives you a Blink on a 15s cooldown, but with about 1500 range? Who knows.

We have multiple problems in League - like damage creep, mobility creep, too much healing (thank god RH got nerfed now) and others. Please let's not amplify these problems (and create new ones) with the help of items.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8h626,In-Game Portrait Changes are a Potentially Worrying UI Issue,"A lot has changed over the years in League with many issues getting brought up with visual clarity over certain skins and how certain teamfights can be incredibly hard to tell what's going on for new players. However, despite all that, the one consistent over the years is that the mini-map portraits for each champ are the same throughout every skin (Kayn aside I'll mention that at the end). 

 https://imgur.com/RZj6k8E Battle Academia Yone (sorry midbeast you just had the first access to the portrait I could find)

 https://imgur.com/dYBV0J0 Base Yone

Recently I played a game with an enemy using the new Battle Academia Yone skin and at a quick glance at the mini-map during a gank I couldn't tell at an immediate glance. To be fully honest, the portrait looks more like a dyed hair Sett than Yone and it genuinely worries me for future skin releases. The main issue I have is that there's already so many things that every player, new and old, has to remember about the game which includes vital information gathered from a half second glance at a mini-map. With that, I don't believe any champion that doesn't have a major gameplay/form change like Kayn should have their portrait changed. There is no real reason to have to potentially add  multiple champion portraits into your memory for each champ when there's already so much to learn about the game.

As promised I mentioned I'd address Kayn and I believe that his portrait change is fine as base Kayn, blue Kayn, and red Kayn are such FUNDAMENTALLY different champions that the change is required for you to know what you are about to fight. Yone however, does not have any gameplay changes throughout the game and should honestly stay the same.

All in all, leave the changes to the skin itself and the splash arts, please leave in game portraits alone :)",leagueoflegends
t3_m7qbg6,I want a permanent pve game mode.,"I truly love this game, I like the characters, the skills, the theme of the game and absolutely love the mechanics.

I've been playing this game since season 2 and I'm finding hard lately to enjoy playing against other people. I don't find fun stomping other people or being stomped, watching persons play cheese or meta champs over and over. However I've had so much fun playing game modes like Odyssey or Doom Bots with friends. I liked so much the experimentation with the characters, things like Ziggs healer man.

I wouldn't mind if they just added the past events so that players could replay them even if they added no new content. Also it wouldn't cost them too much as the events have already been developed.

There would be much more to do as a player than rankeds, normals and arams...

t3_m8ygs8,Illaoi - the most anti-fun champion in the game,"Incoming ""someone just got destroyed by illaoi"" comments

No. Even when I win lane against this champion its just completely unfun. Her Q hitbox is objectively broken. At least start by fixing that.

Playing against Illaoi in lane means you dont get to play League, instead you play tentacle dodging simulator. The worst part of Illaoi is her E which basically is what she is reliant on to be viable. IMO, its the worst, most anti-fun, anti-engaging ability in the game. If you get hit by it, your options are: try to fight back and promplty die or lose 75% of your hp, or run away like a little bitch and have to dodge tentacles and lose CS.

This is where ppl try to defend her by saying ""Just Dodge her E"". This is like that guy saying ""just click on her head"" to kill mercy in OW back when she was broken. First, if you are melee, and have to get, you know, in melee range to do anything against Illaoi, you cant dodge her point blank E. Second, even if you do, its CD is fucking LOW. ""Just fight her in the 4 second window she doesn't have her E and then go back to playing like a little bitch"".

In the links I have given, there are recordings with the concepts of the skills as if they were meant to look like. As I am not a graphic designer and I do not know much about animation, I decided to use the internet and my memory and used some of the skills from Silkroad Online to visualize what I wanted to present to you and I think it will help you imagine what I do I had in mind at the time of writing this character.

*A female warrior from Ioniia. She wields the weapons of Glaive, and during her time in Ixtale, she mastered the elements, which she uses to infuse her weapons with them. She learned to wield this weapon in her childhood in Ionia, but her desire for continuous development and learning directed her towards Ixtal, where she learned the secrets of elemental powers, their controlling and saturating weapons with various elements.*

**Passive skill:** After reaching the following levels: 4, 7, 10 and 13 you will have to choose one of the elements(Fire, Ice, Lightning) and put them in one of your spells or on basic attack.

*(When an elements is added to basic attack it gets a cooldown of 8 second)*

**Fire** **-** He adds additional damage to your basic attack or the selected ability and deals additional true damage over 2 second.

**Ice** **-** He makes your opponent have a lowered movement speed about 15% on 1 second and you deal an additional physical damage on your first attack.

  
**Lightning** **-** After an attack with this effect you gain additional movement speed and attack speed on 3 second and your attack deals additional physical/magic damage.

*(Effect/Mark from your last element on enemies remains on the 5 second form your last attack with any element.)*  
*(Graphical representation: the opponent is slightly red (fire), blue (ice) or green (lightning) depending on the element.)*

Combinations of passive skills:

**Fire and Ice:** When opponent is under an effect of Fire and you attack in period of time with Ice effect then this impose an effect Grievous wounds and creates a small explosion that deals damage to enemies (minions, monsters, heroes) in a small area without applying the Grievous Wounds effect to them. *(reverse order of effects works the same)*

**Fire and Lightning:** The enemy is paralyzed (silence - he cannot use the skill for 1 second) and the opponent is set on fire for 3 seconds, which causes inevitable damage. *(reverse order of effects works the same)*

**Ice and Lightning:** Apply a paralysis *(silence for 1 sec)* effect to an enemy and immobilize them for 1-1.5 seconds. *(reverse order of effects works the same)*

**Skill Q** (has evolution at the maximum skill level)

This is the ability to pierce your opponent with the front of the Glaive. A successful attack reduces the opponent's Armor value for 2 seconds.

Skill deals physical damage: 100% value + 25% and applies the effect of the selected element. [https://youtu.be/uoyPU6TVS98](https://youtu.be/uoyPU6TVS98)

**Version 1:** When the skill Q is maxed, a second attack is added, i.e. our character performs two attacks, one after the other, which are stronger 100% + 50%, but at the cost of the activation speed of this skill, our character will have to perform 0.5 seconds charge to attack. [https://youtu.be/4gmqWtT9aLE](https://youtu.be/4gmqWtT9aLE)

**Version 2:** (activation after the first use of the skill) Our character and the spear rotate around himself (within 0.5 sec) and then make a charge that lasts for 2 seconds and during this time the damage is significantly increased 100% + 75% and for the duration of these 2 seconds, his movement speed is increased by the given amount. [https://youtu.be/r6OVn6iMzbU](https://youtu.be/r6OVn6iMzbU)

**The W skill**

**Elemental Missile** **-** Your last passive attack defines which element it will be. (when you add the first point, the player decides which element he wants to have first or give Projectile of Ice as a permanent element *(variant 1)*)

**Fireball** **-** Deals damage (AP) in a small area from fire and sets enemies on fire for 2 seconds, dealing true damage.

**Projectile Ice** *(variant 1)* \- The enemy hit is slowed by 25% for 1.5 seconds and takes base damage from Ability Power (AP)

**Version 1:** Lightning Bolt - This bolt jumps between opponents, dealing damage with ability power and applying a paralysis (silence) effect for 0.75 seconds.

**Version 2:** Lightning Ball - Deals damage from ability power. The enemy hit has a reduced armor value and the percentage of damage you deal becomes true.

**Skill E**

Throw Glavia to which the chain is attached and which is connected to the hero. Hitting Glavia pierces the rival and deals damage from the missing amount of health points + 65% of the value of physical damage and the opponent is under the effect of ""on a leash"", which means that he cannot go further than the range, e.g. 800 units from the hero, and passive effects are applied, such as the player chose for this skill and activates a passive ability with a combination of elements. After 1.5 seconds, the opponent frees himself, as long as the player has not performed any action. During these 1.5 seconds, your character cannot attack *(because he is unarmed but you get additional Armor and Magic resist or a shield that increases from Max HP + / or default value)* and the only thing you can do is pull yourself to the opponent *(when attracted to the rival is also slightly attracted to you by e.g. 50 units)* or wait for the rival to break up. Additionally, when the opponent breaks up, he is struck by a passive ability from Lightning, giving you all its effects and applying a combination of passive effects to the opponent, if he was marked with a different passive ability (fire, ice).

[https://youtu.be/duAu6azIq4E](https://youtu.be/duAu6azIq4E)

**The skill of R**

For 1 second, the character accumulates the strength of the three elements and transfers it to his weapon, then stabs Glavia into the ground, which releases the collected energy and creates 3 waves, each at 0.4 second intervals at various distances. The waves travel in all directions, forming a circle.

The first wave creates an area of ice that slows enemies by 70% in its area - 600 units away.

The second wave is a lightning discharge that paralyzes (silences) enemies for 1-1.5 seconds. If the opponent was under the effect of Ice, the effect of the combination of Ice and Lightning is applied to him, i.e. he is immobilized for 1-1.5 seconds - a distance of 800 units.

The third wave releases a wave of flames from the hero, which sets enemies on fire, dealing true damage within 2 seconds. Passive skills from the Fire + Ice and Fire + Lightning combinations are also activated (depending on the last effect applied to the opponent) - a distance of 1000 units. *Additionally, the character remains unarmed for the duration of the wave propagation, so he gains a basic shield that increases with AD / AP or maximum health. After the fall is over, the remaining shield disappears within 0.5 seconds and the weapon is pulled to the hero with a chain.*

Alternative: After accumulating energy and transferring it to the weapon, the hero can throw it at a distance of 400 units and from this point the shock waves will start spreading.",leagueoflegends
t3_m8xhol,"Akali sucks, here's why.","**Tl;dr - Akali needs some changes, I've attached a written up rework with some tweaks to her kit. If it is not mentioned, it has not changed. Thanks for reading, and hang in there if you go to look for the exposition! :)**  


Before all the Akali simps get mad-- I'm an Akali main too. /jk  


/srs Granted, my rank has never met pro level and I definitely don't play at pro level, I have been playing the game long enough to know when something isn't working.   


**The Akali rework ISN'T WORKING. THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION.**   
I think a good point of reference for this line of thinking is the changes they made to Leblanc/Kog'Maw. These kits were terrible and extremely hard to balance without completely shafting the playerbase/the champion's numbers as a whole.  


In no way am I saying that the Akali rework is BAD. I actually think it's not the worst thing ever but the problem is that it's way too hard to balance. **When she's nerfed she's not as fun as other picks. When she's buffed, she too overbearing and gets abused (Especially in upper tiers)**   


I've thought of some suggestions(Below) that keep Akali similar to what she currently is, but modifies her kit to have important decisions to make when entering the fray. Again, this is not my opinion, and I am **obviously** not as antiquated with the mechanics it takes to be a challenger player/pro scene player... I just love Akali and currently feel she is both unfun to play, and play against.  


**Here's a thing I made!**   


Q is similar to Old akali, but with a twist.  


W was replaced. A shroud that obscures Akali from vision is just a SHIT mechanic both playing against. It forces her to stay in one area for cover, and offers no REAL decision making.  


It would instead turn her W into a utility ability similar to the original Katarina W by adding some extra depth to her decision making.  


Empowering W obviously isn't possible, so it's marked as ""none.""  


Q Empowered offers the ability to fight in teams and deal damage to multiple opponents, albeit with a longer cooldown. When used this way it does not restore energy, or mark the targets hit. It grants her some healing but based on the damage it does to one **CHAMPION** target. There would be no net healing here- that said, with the damage it could deal, flat healing +3% could added up very quickly with her current AP ratios. So, in my head the first target hit, **is the target that calculates healed damage.**

R now has stealth applied to the end of her ult- as in: **once it is cast, and she is on top of the player, she stealths for 1.5 seconds.** This keeps the theme of an Assassin who can dart in an out of combat via stealth **but ties the kind of power a utility like stealth may bring to a long cooldown.** I debated whether the first charge of her ultimate should grant her stealth and haste, but I figured this would play too much like Vayne or Kha'zix. The slow provides great initiate, and can combo really well with her Q. Empowered R adds extra damage, and an amplified **decaying slow.**   


In theory, I feel like the extra damage (even with no scaling) would add extreme preference to empowering her R for the slow and the damage. I feel like there are two ways you could combat this, and those are to scale the damage by level, so maybe 1-100 flat dmg staggered out through 18 levels. Nothing that would make using this spell at level 6 **SO PREFERABLE THAT OTHER OPTIONS SEEM UNVIABLE.** But, inevitably, I think this empowerment is still useful **WITHOUT** the added dmg. Also, while it is point click it's worth noting, and I'll say it again below, **that unmarked targets do NOT grant Akali stealth.**  


Akali should feel like she has to dart in and out of combat, so the added CD to her Q and E once empowered really means the player needs to plan ahead and think out what they will do.  


Okay, finally, the empowered E: I know that the micro stun adds a TON of utility to her ult. This is why I think the second cast of her ult **should be shorter** as bad as it might feel to not be able to engage with the empowered ability- This changed the ability to an **ESCAPE.** Without shroud it's safe to say that Akali would need more options to get away as she is very squishy even with her high damage (and some times, healing). Most notable, the stealth tied to her ult can ONLY be utilized **while attacking with her marked target with her ult.** You have (at most) 3 seconds to get the fuck out and reposition.   


Anyway, let me know what you think, and bump this even if you aren't a fan of it, because at least it's a design idea that could encourage Riot to make meaningful changes to Akali. Thanks for reading. :D

t3_m8wsz1,Why are AP champs so rare (in my elo),"Heyo,

I've recently tried to get better at jungling and I've also discovered Lillia as a new main for myself, so I've been grinding that role quite consistently recently. Though I do really enjoy playing Lillia or any other AP jungler for that matter, I personally don't like the monotony of playing the same champ, or playstyle, more than once or twice in a row.

So because of that I really enjoy playing all different kinds of champions and I love experimenting with different strategies, but what I've recently noticed (especially in jungle) is that playing AD is not really an option most of the time. If you check my [OP.GG](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=ya+boi+axl) you'll see me basically playing a lot of AP junglers unless I'm playing with my premate ""DrJexi"" (Who also primarily plays AD mids)

I counted every non-support champ in my last 10 (non ARAM) games and in all those I've had 25 AD champs to 12 APs and 3 full tanks (1 Magic and 2 Normal damage) and out of those 12 APs, 7 were either me or my premate. The stats for those are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

AD Top: 8

AD Jgl: 3 (+ 2 Tanks with mainly normal damage 1/2 of those being me)

AD Mid: 4

AD Bot: 10

&amp;#x200B;

AP Top: 1 (me) (+ 1 Tank with mainly Magic damage)

AP Jgl: 5 (3/5 being me)

AP Mid: 6 (3/6 Premate)

AP Bot: 0

&amp;#x200B;

If you then disregard the 3 recent games where I played botlane, (2 leona and 1 cait) which I only played to try out new skins so I didn't care about composition you'll see 3 more AP jungle games with only 1 of which having one more AP champ in the comp (so 4/12 champs being AP, 3 of which being me)

So I was wondering why so little players play AP Top/Mid/Jungle. I can see that people around my rank may not try to go beyond the ""good ol' ADC bot"" rule so I can understand why AP bots are so rare but I really don't understand why APs on other roles are. It's quite frustrating to be forced on an AP champ when I feel like playing something that happens to be AD because my team doesn't pay attention or care about our comp.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8mymi,How To Know When To Drop League,"This is.... a weird post for me. A little background is necessary, considering it affects how I play the game. I have a couple of mental health issues, mostly PTSD and BPD, along with major depression.   
I wanted to ask some of you in the sub what you think of my situation and if I should drop league. Ultimately it's up to me, but I feel that if I am a burden to other players, maybe I shouldn't be playing the game even if I'm having fun. I go by CryptoCultist in the game, and my stats are pretty subpar. I'm level 226 and bronze, I'm still on my first account, and I've been playing for about 3 years. I really enjoy playing with my friends, and I love the game dearly. I've spent a lot of money to get my favorite cosmetics, and on some characters, I really do well. But on a usual basis, if you look at my stats, I don't do well. I often get a lot of heat and the final breaking point for me was when someone pointed out that it may be time to just stop playing it if I'm level 200 and still this bad. It's getting pretty hard to stay positive when every few games I get some pretty toxic experiences just because I'm struggling.   
I really do enjoy the game, even if I'm bad, and I love playing with my friends, it's one of the only things that bring us together. I even restrict myself to not play the characters I have high masteries on because I know that just means they're cheap and easy (like lux and illaoi). I'm just concerned that I shouldn't be playing if Im never going to be good. I feel like I'm ruining the game for others. My mental health is pretty great right now, but this has been weighing on me for a bit. I don't even have the courage to tell my friends that I've been considering this, because I know they'd tell me they don't mind.

The Reap Smite LoL Championship is a league for lower ranked players that don't get a chance to play in other leagues because of their rank and find it hard to improve because of it. It is a league with 2 divisions, one consisting of players iron to silver and one consisting of gold to platinum players. If you are caught with a rank above platinum you and your team will get a punishment. Teams will be drafted by the captains that the admin team select. There will be 1 game a week and there will be 7 games in the season. Every game will be a best of 1 until playoffs then it will be a best of 3 and the championship will be a best of five. The day and times of games will be discussed between teams and put down on our game time spreadsheet. Every game will be streamed and casted on Twitch.

If you are above Platinum in rank you can be a coach for the higher and lower division. However, if you are Gold you can be a coach for the lower division but not the higher division. If you can't or don't want to play you can be a Coach, Caster, Mod, or Streamer. If you just want to come watch and chill you're more than welcome too. We are looking for help and we would love for you to join and come help the lower ranked players get better.

We will not have a prize pool until further notice. We will however be giving out awards at the end of the season and have an all-star game. We will try our best to keep stats and have them posted in a timely manner.

We hope to see you there and enjoy our league!

t3_m8v9bl,League + Friends + Op.gg = Asobi.gg (accepting beta waitlist),"Check out asobi.gg, a discovery platform for League of Legends summoners to find, play, and socialize with each other. We are currently accepting beta waitlist. Swipe and find summoners who fit your needs (rank, role, or queue preference). Finding friends or a potential duo partner shouldn't be difficult. We're not going to stop at League of Legends, in the future, we'll expand to TFT, Valorant, and more.

A little bit about me: I'm a 25 year old self-taught web developer. I built this all by myself, and do not have the funds to advertise it. I am a League player myself, and I have been playing for over 7 years. I know how annoying it is to not be able to find a duo partner. I have checked out a lot of other websites myself, but they are either too difficult to sign up, only cater to casual or competitive, or they are outdated. This is my passion, and I dream of being able to help more League of Legends players find each other.

Again: you'll be joining a beta waitlist, so I can see what the demand is, and fix any bugs before opening it up to everyone.",leagueoflegends
t3_m8bm4r,Should I buy armor as an ADC if enemy team is full AD,"If I am playing ADC and at least 4 of the 5 enemy champions are AD should I buy an armor item? If so, what armor item should I buy? Right now I’ve been stuck between Frozen Heart, Randuins Omen, or Guardian Angel. Frozen heart is cheaper but gives less armor than Randuins and gives worse stats for ADC’s while Randuins has a good active, better stats but is more expensive. And Guardian Angel is normal in ADC builds but has far less armor. Which item should I build?",leagueoflegends

(Btw, the value of this first episode does not lie within insane game play or anything like that, but the commentary - and perhaps watching me fail to some extend)

I play many others champs as well, so if you have an idea or maybe a wish for something I should try out or maybe make a guide on, let me know and I'll try to make it happen - I'm up for anything, even crazy theory crafts and the like. Take your best shot, I'll make it work!

t3_m8migb,11.6 could be the Xin Zhao and Volibear patch,"The most recent patch, 11.6, featured a few nerfs to some prominent champs in the meta like gnar, hecarim, renekton, and urgot while buffing some unplayed champs. Those buffs could lead to a new meta. I'm going to talk about Xin zhao and Volibear.   


AP Xin could be very viable in the JG, just like AP shyv was, if people didn't look at the patch notes, everything gained AP scalings, especially the ult with a massive 1.1 ap ratio, that means if you have 600 ability power, you're doing an extra 660 magic damage on his ultimate. It's a crazy ratio, on top of it, his W and E interactions allow him to be more mobile in the jungle and allow him to cross walls he couldn't. His W applies challenge AND reveals them, and his E dash range increases against ""challenged"" targets. This means he can W over a wall, and E over it, and at a far distance. The dash range is 1100, that's a little bit shorter than ezreal Q, which also means you can smite steal over walls by W, E R smite over the wall. Your engage range also increased drastically, you can W E R and walk out scott free because of the knockback. AP xin could be disgusting. And even if Xin doesn't go full ap, his build options has skyrocketed, you can go AD, tank, and AP, you can build triforce into zhonyas if you care, bc they all work just fine for him with his AP ratios as an AD champion.   


Volibear could be the next hecarim/udyr like champion, turbo chemtank tank junglers who just run at people and kill them. Volibears base damage has always been disgusting(for any LEC fans, remember bwipo's volibear against g2 in week 3?) and his ability to towerdive is crazy with his ultimate. The biggest thing that changed is his sustain and ability to take down epic monsters. With the buffs, his W healing doubled and if you spam W in the jungle, you can full clear without using smite and finish with full hp(as long as you're W'ing properly, which is using it twice on the same monster for healing). Many people who don't play volibear may not know but his E, which is an aoe slow and shield to himself, does magic damage AND % of the targets maximum hp, and against objectives, the cap was raised to 750 magic damage, this means early game objectives, his level 1 E will do several hundreds of damage, think of it as a mini nunu Q, it's almost the same thing but just worse. He can take dragons better, and clear better, so I think volibear will be on the rise.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8tq4l,Is losers queue and winners queue a real thing in league?,"Hi.  
I am a diamond 3 player on EUW and I have played the game for 7 years  and through out the years I have never had a huge problem with the ranked system. Yes, sure there were trollers, inters people who afk, those things happen now as well but now, this season especially I feel like the game is sometimes against me or sometimes on my side. Let me explain.

Some games I will play the game and play average, even bad, but my teammates are winning their lanes, doing good and I get carried. No one on my team is autofilled and they do a good job. On the other side, on the enemy team, there is one or two autofills, someone who is  first timing champions, someone who plays normal games or arams and decides to play ranked for the first time in 3 months. Or there are people with a lot of games and under 45% winrate. And that happens constantly, but the problem is I am either on the side who has these players who I just described or I am on the side who has the better players and everyone is on their role. It feels like no matter how good or bad I play, no matter how much I stomp lane, help my jungler, help other lanes it feels like the game is decided by who has the more autofilled players, the ones who firs time champions, who haven't played ranked in months, or have a really bad winrate. It feels like I am not in control at all and its just a game of chance in which side I get on when I queue up. And I don't mind losing, I don't mind playing a good game and losing afterwards but the problem is that it feels that sometimes I am stuck in games in which the players are significantly worse than players on the enemy team. And this season, for the first time in 7 years I already know a game is lost after I check their [op.gg](https://op.gg), and it feels like once you are stuck in that loseers queue u need a lot of games to get out of it, to just hop into a winners queue and the same process is on repeat. As I said I have never felt more stuck in this game in these 7 years I have played, and as i started watching more streams especially this season I have noticed most players are constantly using the words ,,winners"" or ,,losers"" queue. I have tried not using [op.gg](https://op.gg) with the mindset I would not want to know who are my teammates who are the enemies in order do not tilt myself before the start of the game but it doesn't change a thing. And one more thing, I feel like I get thrown into the losers queue the moment I get on a streak I start playing well. And I do continue to play well I often end up being the one player on the team with most cs, most kill participation and all that jazz but it never feels enough because the other teammates are outclassed by the enemies. Is this type of thing real, how do u get out of it and if it's real why would a game literally punish you if you do good and put you with worse players and make the game feel like a game of chance.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8ddlz,"So, I'm intrested in League for very long time but never acutally played it and want to proove that Plat elo is just game knowledge","So backstory

I know about league since the old map was on, I was watching it because I was playing lots of Warhammer 40k and that was similar to RTS(kinda silly but yea it was new format), never touched the game itself expect playing a tutorial as Ashe and didnt continue because I was familar with my RTS games and went into FPS games. So as, in my opinon, RTS genre kinda died so I have time to proove the point that anything below high Diamond is based only on game knowledge.

So I grinded account playing Bots only to just learn few champions, after hitting lvl 30 I went straight into ranked mode and so far Im 3-0 with avg KDA 5.5 (was watching t1 and other adc players so Im feeling the most confident there). Gonna update my progress at the end of each day with [op.gg](https://op.gg) link/screens. First update will be today at 22 UTC as soon as I come home.

Details of my challange:

7 days time

Playing botlane only

Played this game for around 50h (leveling acc time on bots with first wins each day)

The main goal of this challange is to get as high as its possible, the minimum I want  to achive is Plat 4.

Playing only soloq

Server EUW

EDIT:

So, I know most of champs perfectly (like 70%, problems with passives only tho cuz werent able to observe most of them on stream.)

So I will limit myself to play until Ill get into autopilot mode (was having that in RTS games) when I will just stop thinking and go full learned behaviours.

As one of you suggested, Im playing easy champs (trist,jhin,cait,xayah are main targets)

Im using every tool possible in game to make it easier (skinchanger for default enemy team, Blitz for builds and scout my teammates in future)

EDIT 2: Linking [op.gg](https://op.gg)

[https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=+ED%C3%86N](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=+ED%C3%86N)

Started to feel very anxious about farming, not my best aspect of the game, even tho haven't lost laning phase yet, got very big problems with playing against vel koz cuz I had no idea how his passive works

Feeling like its impossible to get through plat tho, I cant position my self as adc and my farming sucks compared to plat (at least from blitz stats), wave management is harder to implement than to learn theoretically but still Im able to pull it out sometimes

Yea, so I realised that this game is so unplayable when you are getting teamed with a player who is insanely bad, I got brand support who did 0/3 in 4 mins and 0/10 in 14, like bruh cmon it doesn't matter how I can play I will still be able to lose the match. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you can handle me any tips for winning more matches (like pure experience things like how to communicate accuratly with ur teammates because in those 3 rankeds I felt twice that some players are having pings disabled.

&gt;You guys gave me a 2nd half to my career. You made this fun for me again and I will forever be grateful for the time I was able to be your Coach. I love you guys.

His tweet makes it sound like there was some kind of falling-out with his last team, Golden Guardians Academy. They finished 9th in the NA Academy 2021 Spring Split and just yesterday, hours after his announcement, played and won the [Giant Slayer Gauntlet Final](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Giant_Slayer_Gauntlet/2021_Season/Spring) against [EG Academy](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/m7gwcu/eg_academy_vs_gg_academy_giant_slayer_gauntlet/). This comes only a week after the GGA assistant coach SeeEl [announced he was leaving the team](https://twitter.com/coachseeel/status/1369925271416016900).

He sounds a bit defeated and sad, so I hope he finds happiness in whatever he does next. I even remember meeting him at MSI 2018 in Berlin, but not even he could explain the [Sejuani support pick from Hylissang in the FNC vs KZ match](https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8jkcj6/fnatic_vs_kingzone_dragonx_msi_2018_group_stage/) to me.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8lg1g,My take on the Trinity Force issue,"There has been a lot of talk about Trinity Force being made into a legendary item, or reworking the mythic passive.

I think making a legendary item could work for sure, but not because the item isn't good enough to be a mythic item.

The problem with Trinity Force being a mythic is you are almost completely locked away from sustain as a bruiser if you choose to itemise into it.

For the longest time Triforce users such as Fiora, Irelia, Wukong, Camille liked to build Trinity with old Death's Dance and Ravenous Hydra. Their strong suit was sustain in duels.

The current iteration of Ravenous Hydra is terrible. The value of the item is loaded into the CDR and barely gives any healing anymore. On top of that it no longer gives the old Tiamat active. (Which you are also locked out of if you choose to buy Trinity Force).

The other sustain items for bruisers are BotRK (Which again is loaded more into the damage than the sustain, though in this case I believe that is the correct choice), and Goredrinker, which you cannot get with Trinity Force.

I think the lack of available sustain options for ""Trinity Force Champions"" (If you can even call them that anymore) is why we are seeing them shift over to shieldbow.

TLDR:Trinity users last season loved being healy healy bois. Now there are no healy healy options.",leagueoflegends

Sometimes taking a player out is more of a statement to the player than just saying ""this guy is better than you and will now start."" If you have ever been on a sports team or follow professional sports you probably understand this a little more. In basketball if a great player is cold or doing dumb shit the coach might decide to bench them. Now I do see a case when clearly the better player is benched from what the fans see as too long, and theres a discussion to be had there. But in eastern leagues especially where the coach player dynamics are a lot different if your coach makes the tough call to put you on a bench, no matter who you are it means a lot and gives the player the realization that he isnt doing enough. Like look at Faker man the past 2 series he has been stunning, and even faker acknowledges the benching was valid and necessary. In the grand scheme of things I would much rather have faker at this current power level than what he was showing earlier in the year. Theres so much context and nuance that your average viewer gets left out on its really hard to get a true feel for the factors playing into a gamer getting benched.",leagueoflegends

I'm not good enough of a player to refute the information. Any good players care to give their opinion on it? Basically they say flat pen &gt; Percent pen,"""I have found, tested, and abused a build so OP that I am confident if you post a video on it and your viewers pick it up, it will result in a nerf. This is well beyond Senna crit guinsoo's broken and also has to do with haywire calculations. I've written a full explanation so you can get an understanding of this insanity.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Pantheon breaks lethality calculations and does beyond true damage to nearly all targets.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, people build Pantheon all wrong. They go eclipse, cleaver, and other bruiser items as well as going concqueror because he can quickly stack it. To be clear, this is still a good build, but it actually has some major mathematical flaw relating to armor penetration order of operations.

&amp;#x200B;

The way armor pen is calculated in League is in four steps:

1. Flat Reductions
2. Percent Reductions
3. Percent Penetration
4. Flat Penetration

&amp;#x200B;

Flat changes stack additively and percent changes stack multiplicatively. What does that mean? It means that if you have two instances of reducing or penetrating through 100 armor by 10 and10, you have 100 - 10 - 10 = 80. However, if you have two instances of 10%, you have 100 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 81. What happens is that the percent changes decrease the effectiveness of the next percent instance. If I have Pantheon's 30% pen passive and Serylda's Grudge of 30% pen, the resulting pen is 49% instead of the expected 60%. If you also throw in an Eclipse, which should have 16% pen, you only get 41%. That's Awful!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, people think since Pantheon has armor pen build in, you should lean into getting more. This is entirely wrong. Armor penetration % by being calculated before lethality, actually should be paired with the flat penetration of lethality. Whereas armor % pen reduces the efficiency of the next instance of their %, it INCREASES the effectiveness of flat pen by that amount. Actually, because armor is logarithmic, it increases the effectiveness of lethality exponentially.

&amp;#x200B;

To be exact, Pantheon's 30% innate armor penetration increases the effectiveness of Lethality by 42.8%

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get into the build....

&amp;#x200B;

1. Prowler's Claw
2. Essence Reaver
3. Boots
4. Lethality Item
5. Lethality Item
6. Blade of the Ruined King

&amp;#x200B;

This build with Sudden Impact will give you 30% armor penetration and 84 lethality (or 72 at the lowest). What this means is that you will do TRUE DAMAGE to anyone at or below 120 armor (103 at the lowest).

&amp;#x200B;

Prowler's Claw also comes with a badass trick. You can use it to climb the wave and then leap stun someone who doesn't expect it. Because of how overloaded with damage this build is, you do not need to use it on your target.

&amp;#x200B;

Essence Reaver is the best item on Pantheon in the game. It has everything he could want and sustains him. He casts his Q and W so often that it's procced like crazy, and he can take towers with ease because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The two lethality items you want to get are Youmoo's and Serpent's Fang, depending on Matchup. The Collector is also good and adds more crit chance, but it has less lethality and flat AD than Youmoo's. Pantheon has insane AD ratios, so getting these items are a big part of why this is better than regular bruiser Pantheon.

&amp;#x200B;

You've already tried BOtRK and you know its busted on him, it is what takes this from a build that one shots everyone and third healths tanks to one shotting the tanks as well. Keep in mind that you are doing true damage, so BOtRK does a true 10% Current health.

&amp;#x200B;

When this doesn't work:

&amp;#x200B;

You might think that this is a shit build if the enemy team has tanks. You would be terribly wrong. If you go the typical build of Eclipse and Cleaver on him, the beak even point of penetration between the standard and my wacky build occurs at 304 armor. That's right - you have to be a mega tank for the penetration to be equal! And suppose you don't build the cleaver. The breakeven point doesn't occur until 687.5 armor. No one builds 687.5 armor.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the mathematically correct way to build the champion.

&amp;#x200B;

Runes:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Press the Attack
2. Triumph
3. Alacrity (Tenacity if needed)
4. Coup de Grace (Cut Down if they have big bois)

&amp;#x200B;

5. Sudden Impact

6. Ravenous Hunter

&amp;#x200B;

You should go Press the Attack. It is absolutely the best rune. Conqueror is the wrong rune choice for anything but tank Pantheon. The empowered W procs PTA, it makes him incredibly dominant in lane, and it means that your damage with all the stuff mentioned above is multiplied even more. You do beyond true damage. You do 112% of the damage applied. Actually, I take that back; because your combo is Empowered W into Q, you likely get them to below 40% before it's done, and Coup de Grace is procced as well. That becomes 1.12 x 1.08 = 1.209% input damage.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. This is some seriously broken shit that I hope you have a blast trying out. Unlike other lethality builds that fall off late, this build actually scales. You can and will always one shot anyone who has less than 3-4 tank items.""",leagueoflegends

Just high damage combined with hyper yet conditional mobility and a niche utility tool that goes from useless to great depending entirely on the matchup.

You could make an argument for Yone, but once you play Yone, you actually feel he is a lot more ""all or nothing"" than Yasuo is. Like, Yasuo can play the lane how he feels like it, but with Yone you feel like you must go in and trade at all times due to the nature of his kit. Akali is closer to Yasuo playstyle wise than Yone can ever be, once you really look at them.

Now, Yasuo is somewhat simple to play, like, sure you'll be spamming E-Q a shitton of times but you'll essentially be playinh Yi with extra steps, however he also supports an absolutely gigantic learning curve, making him popular with both casuals and elite players alike.

Sure his natural vulnerabilities make him not very well suited for a competitive environment, but the fact that he still has his niche at that level is astonishing. Gragas + Yasuo was played as a bot lane duo by G2 for example.

---

Yeah, he makes autopilot midlane mage players want to tear their eyes out, and by extension, he is also somewhat frustrating to ad carry players.

But that's more of a learn to play issue than anything else tbh. If Yasuo was to be reworked, Zed would simply take his place as the most hated, and if Zed was reworked, then it'd be Talon.

People who autopilot every lane have trouble dealing with champions who have any sort of kill pressure on them. It's just second nature at this point, and sure, it's ok to be bad at the game, however these are the people who then come on reddit to complain about whatever arbitrary shit beat them that day and end up creating threads about ""Darius being too fast"" or some shit like that.",leagueoflegends

There are amounts of damage that are unreasonable, no matter how many times a 0-10 adc dying to 25-0 Talon gets posted. 30-40% of champs picked in competitive are marksmen, Gangplank is top tier, Yone is top tier.

The reverse is also true, if I see a Fiora ban picking after me I know I have to play a safe blind pick like Gnar.

I get it if its a 5 stack or clash as lots of trades happen anyway with coordinated teams. But for solo que trading is rare and often leads to an extremely volatile lobby.

t3_m8fylk,Better Runes Selection,"Okay, so we have Item pages that can have specific characters, it could be one, two or more. When you go in game, it automatically gets that one page up you've set for your character. If you have multiple, you can just switch between them. Although the limit for these pages is 100, it's not the end of the world.

Now, the problem is when you play a variety of different characters and you need to have runes for them all just so that you don't need to go and try to find which runes for the character you've just picked up are needed. 

Why can't we just have an option to add the specific characters to our runes like we can with items? It will be such a quality of life change! I have mixed out on runes pages as usually when I game with my friends I get distracted and never remember to go online and look up runes. Sometimes things change as you are about to find a game. Maybe to counter, maybe a role change etc. I know there are multiple ways of ensuring you get the right runes but I really want to move from something like - IllMorYonAaAkaJaxKatRySin to - Top Laner Push or whatever you wanna name it as it wouldn't matter as you can pick the runes for your character.",leagueoflegends

TL;DW is that if a team gets hard outdrafted (please watch the video for many many reasons on how and why this can happen) neither team really wants to play as or against the badly drafted team because its not good practice so its ok to dodge if both teams agree to it.

t3_m8k0ru,A comment about Season 1 and the world championship,"this is something I wanted to say and I know it seems pretty random. But a lot of pros and commentators look down upon Season 1 and the world championship at the time but let me say this a lot of the players that were in that tournament as well as some of the members that won in that final weren't exactly shitters at the game.

It's not like the players who won and played for the world championship in that season then fell off into oblivion. SOAZ, YellowStar, HotShotGG, Chauster, Doublelift, Dyrus, Xpeke, Cyanide and many others all played in that tournament and then this is the important part many of those players went on to **dominate** in their respective regions afterwards for many years afterwards.

Soaz, Yellowstar linked up with Xpeke and Cyanide to begin one of the greatest dynasties in EU LoL Esports history.

That TSM team with the addition of Dyrus went on to establish one of the greatest legacies in NA LoL Esports history.

So it's not like these players were shitters, because they went on from season 1 to dominate in their regions for many years afterwards even when the scene was exploding in popularity. They proved they weren't just the first to turn up to the party and take advantage of the lack of competition so to speak, many proved and earned the right to be called some of the greatest players from their regions.

Even today many still consider Doublelift to be the greatest ADC NA has ever produced and Xpeke and Soaz to two of the best solo laners EU has ever produced. 

Yes the teams were probably bad in comparison to teams today, yes the players probably weren't as good as they are now. But bear in mind the game was only out for a year at that point so what can you possible expect? Yes the Koreans and Chinese weren't there yet but that's not their fault that the Korean servers weren't up and running then. I use the same analogy I used for the first World cup should be expunge Uruguay's achievements because the Italians and the Germans didn't participate?

Everything has a beginning and this is all part of the tapestry that makes LoL Esports so great we should celebrate where League started and pay respect to how far the Esport, community and scene has come in almost 10 years! Not admonish it like some ugly embarrassment. Without that embarrassment many people may not even be playing the game today.  

I'm proud to say that I watched that event and I'm still mind blown by far the scene has come, Riot should be proud of themselves for what they've built man. Many of the players may not realize it and may not hold much regard for that tournament but it started the domino effect which has led us to the point where we are now.",leagueoflegends

Quoting directly from them, if you don't really have time to read all of it:

Exhibit A

&gt;Shari reached out to me in Summer 2020 \[...\] she told me about her plan to file a lawsuit against Mr. Laurent \[...\] I told her that Mr. Laurent never did anything wrong to me \[...\] I told Shari that I had never seen anything inappropriate between Mr. Laurent and Shari.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;After Shari's lawsuit was filed, I received many calls, texts, and messages from journalists \[...\] I lost my job with another employer because of all the harassment that I received from journalists \[...\] I know that it must have been Shari that gave out my number to journalists \[...\] on February 16, 2021 Shari called me \[...\] She told me that she either gave my number to journalists or her attorney  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;I am concerned that Shari will misuse my personal information \[...\] I'm afraid for my personal identity and security since I know Shari gave out my number to the press.

Exhibit B

&gt;I understand that Shari recently filed a lawsuit against Mr. Laurent for sexual harassment. I haven't experienced anything like that while working for Mr. Laurent, and I've never seen or heard anything inappropriate between him and Shari. I think she made up the claims in her lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;I began receiving strange and threatening calls on my cell phone at the end of February, 2021 \[...\] The first call \[...\] a woman said that she was the assistant to Shari's lawyer \[...\] She said that we needed to talk about Shari's lawsuit \[...\] I don't think that woman was Shari \[...\] A few days later, I received another call \[...\] The woman then said that I could ""get money out of"" the Laurent family \[...\] The woman then called my a ""b\*\*ch"", said ""f\*\*k the Laurents"".  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]

&gt;I received another call \[...\] a man said, ""is this f\*\*king \[REDACTED\]?"" in an aggressive and threatening tone \[...\] the man then said I ""need\[ed\] to be united with Shari"" so that ""all this lawsuit shit can come to a conclusion"" \[...\] The man then told me ""I know where you live"" \[...\] I am not sure who the man and woman were, but I think that Shari gave them my number and told them to call and intimidate me. I'm scared that Shari will escalate these threats \[...\] When I got these calls, I told Mr. Laurent and his wife because I was worried about them and their three little kids. I wasn't sure what Shari might do next.

t3_m8ngua,My first expirience in normal Draft Pick,"Ok, so I've started playing PC version of LoL 4-5 days ago, got to level ten and unlocked mission to play normal Draft Pick. I saw that I needed 20 champions unlocked so I just bought 9 more from the cheapest champions available. I had **0 idea what that mode** **was**, so I just jumped in and thought that I just learn from there. I waited like 15 minutes to find a match, which I thought, was really weird. 

When I finally got into the game I needed to **choose a champion what I want to lock** (at least it said ""lock"" in translation for my language), so I thought ""oh, **the game wants me to choose a champion what I want to play until the end of game without switching**, kinda like playing Overwatch without the ability to switch heroes"". I obviously chose **Ahri**, since I've been playing her almost exclusively. Then the game wanted me to choose a second champion, so I thought it's a backup champion or something? I just choose **Annie**, even though I have **never played as her before**. So I've got into a match as **Annie**, which I thought was weird, since I thought she's supposed to be a backup or whatever but ok. I went to mid and just started playing, but some guy complained that I'm bad and said something about 15 minions or something and that he's going to report me. I answered ""ok"" since it's my first time playing as this champion, so it's fine right? Then Lux, who was playing bottom line, suggested we swap and I just said ""fine, whatever"" so I continued on bottom line. I noticed that the players were much more toxic and hostile than in my normal Blind Pick games though, so that kinda concerned me. Then somebody suggested we surrender but I declined since it was pretty much the beginning of the game, but when I noticed that we were losing 19-6 so I probably should've accepted. I've also asked my team ""what the heck, didn't I chose **Ahri** at the beginning?"" but they didn't reply. Almost at the end when our nexus was almost destroyed, some guy said that I was ""dumb as animal"" or something, so I was really concerned, like is this some tryhard mode or something? 

And then I learned that normal Draft Pick is basically unranked ranked mode and I fucked my whole team over with my play. 

But seriously though, Riot should've put at least some description about what this mode is about and how it works.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8hwkn,Rotatives Gamemodes,"Heyo !
Just came here to discuss about ""rotative modes""

Quotation mark because rotatives modes nowadays only include ARURF (Occasionally URF), OfA and Nexus Blitz
... Since when and why did it became like this ?


For ones who don't know yet, League had experienced so much more fun mode over the time that, it seems, won't be back. And I think, it's a shame.
Let me list some for you:

- *Dominion* (which was an legitimate game mode alongside ARAM), latter included in the rotatives modes as *Definitely not Dominion* :

The rules were basically the same as Summoner's rift, except the MAP (it was in a pentagon shape) and the Win Conditions :
Capture the Territory displaced at the extremities of the Pentagon (and one was at it center if I remember correctly) and earn enough points from them to win the game.

There was minions waves pathing to goes along the Pentagon shape of the map (splitted because of a jungle, that also possess a zone to capture, at the center of the map), pushing to help you conquer and capture each zones.

This game mode is absolutely common in any game, it's a basic Domination mode from e.g CoD or Overwatch, and was retired from the game (but later reintroduced in the rotatives modes) due to his lack of popularity compared to ARAM and, of course, SR.

- *Ascension*

Using the same map as the Dominion, but no minions this time.
Only 3 specific zone to capture (can't remember what they did specifically) at the extremities of the map.
At it center, an (big) ASCENDED NEUTRAL XERATH (which behaved like a Baron Nashor). His death allowed one to ascend, which granted boosted basic stats, size, and infinite mana/energy.

Win conditions: earn enough points by - Kill an enemy champion - Killing as the Ascended - Kill the Ascended (being the Neutral Xerath or an enemy champion) - Capture a zone.

This was a specific limited mode related to an event from 2014

- *Hunt of the Blood Moon*

- Summoner's Rift
- Champions pool restricted to Assassins
- No minions
- No turrets
- No Jungle Monsters except Baron Nashor and some Drakes
- Every now and then, some spirits would spawn in the jungle (acting like Kalista's W, without the restricted area for it pathing)
- Being on a killing spree would grants you a buff (can't remember the specifics about this buff)

Win Conditions : Earn enough points by killing an enemy champions and spirits.

This mode is interesting, since the majority dislike the Metas Tank (that's not my case but whatever), it allowed any skill expression by restricting the lanes usual conditions of the Summoner's Rift and let you kill your opponents at your free will with your assassins.
A great mode for some highlights in short.

- *Overcharge*

 In an 3v3 specific map I won't even try to describe, the champion pool was restricted to the ADCs and the goal was basically  to kill your opponents, and Earn enough points with that.

The map was also filled by some.. truck-like things, but the size and the behavior of a scuttlecrab. Killing 5 of these as a team would grants you all an Overcharge buff : Extra movespeed, Extra CDR, Unlimited mana, Extra points with kills and CD reset upon the buff being granted.

Same as the bloodmoon modd, it's a place for your skill expression. Fun, nervous and... Fun ! ^^ 

- *Singularity*

Probably the FUNNIEST mode of the one I introduced here :
- 3v3
- A specific small map
- EVERYONE IS THRESH
- No R
- No items
- No mana
- Your spells are modified (your Q range is massively increased, your W automatically proc on your allies, your E is the ultimate displacement spell (detailed right below))
- there's a big death star at the center of the map.

The goal was very simple, Earn enough points (once again) by killing your opponents.
The only way to kill them was to throw them into the Dark Star at the center.
The less HP you have, the more you get displaced (Just as Smash Bros)

You can't walk into the Dark Star, but your Q gets buffed if you throw it across the Dark Star. You can dash through.
The only way to die is to actually being forcefully pushed inside.

That gamemode is a Banger.

I'll stop right there, this post is long enough and I still got a few things I wanna discuss about.

First, that's only a few. I may be wrong on some details, or forgot things. If that's the case, I'm sorry about it tho this was a while ago.
I didn't mention the King of Poro, which is fun but the least innovative gamemode, neither Siege or that gamemode which allowed the ARAM ""Marking (/SNOWBALL)"" Sums spell with an unlimited range on the SR since I can't remember the specifics about it.
Neither did I mentioned PvE modes (including Doom Bots)

Secondly, obviously, since that presentation was an introduction for that discussion :
Why ?

Why did it stopped ?

I know that these are the least popular mode if we're comparing them to the Draft and ranked and they're time consuming for the staff.
Well.. The game is growing (more and more), the frustrateds and the haters can spit whatever they want about ""Dead game"" (tho it's been a while now I haven't heard that for League), the game is growing.
And my close friends, which officially joined League last year, will never know about these fun gamemodes ? That's an absolute shame =/

For that even more growing community, new innovative and fun gamemodes should have another chances

Lunar Beast had such a potential of being a new Odyssey/Invasion
Pool Party could replace the theme of King of Poro, with a big Pengu wearing a swim shorts and different spells.

I don't know why the recurring rotatives gamemodes became so.. recurring.
But since everyone wanted URF, maybe it should definitely be added in the game without those balances changes since this gamemode isn't about things being balanced, and then it's definitely shutdown those ARURF stans (sorry guys, but this is the least fun gamemodes ever *whoops*)
(^ Sorry, I just did my part of the job to favor the other gamemodes over the recurring ones, héhé ^^)


Also, not every Pokemon is popular, yet no ones as been left aside by GameFreak :P





Alright, Imma stop here with those small banters ahah ^^

At the very least, you guys can see this as an appreciation post for what is now some of the League's Legacy (but it shouldn't. Definitely. Let's talk about this !)

t3_m84vhi,Do you actually enjoy soloq? - My current problems with it,"I'm not talking about the game itself, I'm talking about soloq specifically. League is obviously fun.

Personally I think riot has let a ticking time bomb alone for the past few years, turning a blind eye on high elo player behavior. I played 6 games today and 3 of them had people intentionally feed, sell items at 9 minutes, or afk. People in high elo know how to just avoid the systems that deal with these issues and riot is doing nothing about it. 

The report system is archaic and only works for people who don't know the boundaries (dying 18+ times, actually leaving the game, saying very bad words)

For me, winning soloq is about having less mentally unstable teammates than the enemy. The slightest setback will make people lose their mind and completely ruin the game.

It doesn't help that queuing to ACTUALLY play a game takes a year or two. People find soloq so unfun that it takes 10-20 minutes to even have a queue pop on 200lp EUNE. Nobody (including me) can be bothered to play more than what we must play to avoid decay.

Meanwhile theres a seemingly 70% chance the lobby is dodged because either someone threatens to feed, or an OTP got his champ banned, or theres funnel (seriously? this is still a thing?), or at least 1 out of the 10 players in the lobby is trying to minmax his 50% winrate mmr by dodging bad teammates/teamcomps.

To sum up, I do not think soloq is fun at all. There's so many things that distract from the actual game itself that makes soloq not even about playing the game. You either have people give up on trying to play it completely (decay gamers) or people who turn their senses off and autopilot 15 games a day, ending the season with 3k games 50% winrate. So it turns out that soloq players just dont care about the game.

Here is the first shot at it. It might need balancing, as the champion will probably use mana 

Passive : the lego champion spawns bricks behind units touched. Lego bricks deal damage to everyone stepping on them.

Q : assemble a handfull. The next attack will spawn more bricks and does more damage.

W: knolling up. The bricks behind the champion at the activation teleport in front of it well organized.

(Slows enemies at higher levels? )

E: catapult. Launches bricks in selected area on a single point

R:  master builder. Passive : attracts bricks to the buider in an area. The further the bricks are from the champion, the faster they go. They don't hurt while moving.

Active : Spawns a unit at the center of an area, and despawns bricks in said area. The more bricks, the bigger the unit. When the unit dies, it spawns XX% of the bricks used to summon it.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7s56j,Practice Tool needs more features to make it more interesting,"[Practice Tool](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Practice_Tool#Commands_1) is the best tool for practicing and testing champs. However there are some things that need to be added or changed.

Here are the features that we may want to request:

# #1 Switching champions + skins during the game

Lots of us will get annoyed when testing various of champs by exiting the game. Everytime we want to change between champions to practice, this will be time-consuming to recreate other games. Also the computer will work a lot to load a game many times.

DOTA 2 already has this feature too but it uses different game engine. The problem with this feature for the Riot Games development team is: this game may has to load all 150+ champions. The computer has to decompress the whole packed files and load them into the game which is something...obvious.

# #2 Changing rune pages + summoner spells in game

Similar to feature #1, if there are some keystones can stack infinitely like Dark Harvest or Grasp of the Undying, changing runes will lose the stack.

# #3 Changing dummies to specific champs + control dummies

In order to make Practice Tool more interesting, we can assign specific champs to play with. I have played Nami and Lulu to see how allies do but they didn't do anything. The dummies we really want that can move, dodge skillshots and interact to each other like human or bot play. We can duplicate the same champs to make it look like One for All game mode, sound interesting right?

Also in DOTA 2, the players can fully the dummy heroes such as using abilities, leveling up and buying items. If Riot Games can add this feature, players may want to test how tanky it is when getting damage (not the turrets and fountain).

Here is the link to illustrate that feature: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglt1-Jthek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglt1-Jthek)

# #4 Hosting a Practice Tool game need to be offline + remove 60 minutes cap

When using Practice Tool, I don't really know why the game need to connect to server meanwhile only us can play this tool alone. Some players who play with poor internet speed will notice this. Connecting to server is one of the main reasons why the game limits to 60 minutes to reduce the server's stress when gathering info too much.

The 60 minutes limit is also a problem, if we use Fast Forward 10 min too much, we cannot have enough time to test for longer. Also we want to test how Bard collecting chimes or how [Gathering Storm](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gathering_Storm) look like after 70, 80, 90 mins.

# #5 Restore destroyed turrets + inhibitors

# #6 Some champions' abilities cannot refresh cooldown when using Auto-Refresh Cooldowns

I don't know whether this is a bug or not.

* When using Sylas \[R\] to steal ultimate abilities, there is an only bot champ that he can steal. The cooldown when stealing the same champ cannot be reset.
* Kindred is more painful, her passive cannot select the dummies for hunting so I have to fast forward every 4 minutes to hunt the same bot. Due to 60 mins limit, this will be a problem for players who are curious about how Kindred will look like when stacking a lot of hunting marks.

There are more of them but I cannot test them all.

t3_m8pa7s,I ready don’t like how it’s became norm for riot to give mini reworks to newly released champions.,"I got into playing lol seriously in season 5 just a bit after bards release and the champions released after during that time were for the most part fine, with maybe a few nerfs or buffs here and there. 
Now as of recently it’s became habit, (a bad one) that riot would release X champion, then maybe a few months to a year later give that champion a mini rework by completely removing or adding things to their kits. 

And it seems riots became more and more comfortable doing this to where it’s pretty much the norm now. The champions that come off the top of my head when I think about this is 
Irelia, removed disarm, and shield breaking (I think?) 

akali, removed true stealth, healing, skillshot ult, energy on passive.

Aurelian sol, changed W.

sylas, removed shield.

Samira Ally cast removed. 


Whatever tf.they did to apehlios.

I think they did something to yuumi aswell not I’m not 100% sure, but that’s just to name a few recent champions off the top of my head while these changes may have been needed it shows a bigger issue with riot releasing champions with overloaded kits that do way too much, and I think it’s unfair continuously releasing stuff like that only to remove it later on and fucking over the new players still trying to learn that champion and making most champion spotlights null and misleading  now days.
If I were a new player and watched akalis champion spotlight I’d go into a game and be reported for inting under towers. I think riot may need to revamp their play testers and they internal champion testing because a lot of things make it to live that just plain shouldn’t be there. 
I guess the point I’m trying to make is it’s really just annoying and feels a bit unprofessional how it’s became normal for riot to make a whoopsies on a new champion and then add or remove things from their kit while the champion is still relatively new, mini reworks should be reserved for older champions that need a bit of modernization but not ready for a VGU yet. They shouldn’t be for when riot wants to backtrack from releasing a champion that does too much. Riot has gotten way too comfortable reworking new champions it’s a bit annoying.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7k8sz,"LPL's seeding race, matches to watch in Week 10 and who I think will win it all","While LEC and LCS are in playoffs and mid-season showdown (or whatever it's called), LPL is coming to Week 10 with 6 teams in contention for 3 playoff spots and 5 teams with the same amount of wins fighting for 2nd seed. Many of you may be new to LPL, so I thought I'd spend a little bit of my time to talk about why I think the last week of LPL will provide some of the best competitive LoL and who I think will make it to playoffs/top 2 or 4.

**Matches to watch:**

**Top Esports vs Royal Never Give Up 3.20 05:00 ET/09:00 GMT**

**Royal Never Give Up vs Rare Atom 3.22 05:00 ET/09:00 GMT**

**Edward Gaming vs Team WE 3.24 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT**

**Top Esports vs Team WE 3.27 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT**

**Edward Gaming vs Rare Atom 3.29 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT (literally last game of the split)**

Every single one of these games could affect the standings of the top seven teams, and therefore affect the seeding and possible the championship points they're guaranteed to get. I talk more about the current standings and who I think will make it below!

**Seeding**

The top 7 teams have all made it into the playoffs but none of the seedings have been confirmed and the rankings can completely shuffle within the last week. The final rankings will decide their seeding in playoffs and how many games they get to skip. Week 10 of LPL will be an exciting one to say the least.

\*\*\*Round 4 Seed (Skips 3 games)  
\*\*Round 3 Seed (Skips 2 games)  
\*Round 2 Seed (Skips 1 game)

Because of how close the top 7 is, literally every single map matters in every single series, and there is absolutely no slacking. Some might argue that seeding doesn't matter, but with how strong some of potential 1st,2nd,3rd seed is, the higher seeding you can get, the more likely you'll be able to get championship points, especially when getting top 2 in the split will **guarantee** you championship points even if you don't win a single game in playoffs. My prediction below is completely **my opinion**, which has some sort of bias, but I tried my best to give objective judgements. Based on my prediction, only two teams will remain in their spot, and teams will change about 10 ranks in total. I also included what I think is the lowest/highest they can get. I believe 2nd-6th place teams will all have the same record, and it will depend on game differential and H2H record.

**1st\*\*\* -** &gt;!Top Esports (13-3, GD: +17)!&lt;

**Upcoming Matches (Spoilers are my predictions)**:

vs RNG (1st) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs TT (15th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs WE (4th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st\*\*\***

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team had an average start to the split despite everyone's expectations, but they have managed to climb back up with an 7 win streak (ongoing). They have shown consistency against some of the best teams and I think they will end up 1st by beating RNG. However, if they lose this game, not only will they drop to 3rd, they could actually end up being 7th if they also lose against WE. Unlikely, but possible.  


**2nd -** &gt;!Edward Gaming (12-4, GD: +16)!&lt;

vs eStar (16th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs WE (4th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs RA (6th) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team has been top 2 in LPL for the past five weeks and I don't see this changing after the last three games. I even predicted them to lose against RA and they would still end up 2nd, but because of how close it is at the top, if they lose against WE, they can still end up 7th. They'll most likely end up 2nd or 3rd depending on game differential.

**3rd -** &gt;!Royal Never Give Up (12-4, GD: +15)!&lt;

vs TES (3rd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs RA (6th) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs LGD (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 5th**

Similar to EDG, they have never dropped out of the top 3, being consistently good and having only lost to BLG and JDG. However, their recent struggles against top teams (0-2 JDG, 2-1 EDG) have shown that their champion pool and playstyle are rather rigid, and they'll most likely save most of their picks for playoffs, which is why I predicted them to lose against both RA and TES, finishing 3rd. I could be completely wrong and they could end up 14-2, but I think they'll at least drop one series in the last three, ending up 2nd or 3rd.

**4th -** &gt;!Funplus Phoenix (12-4, GD: +15)!&lt;

vs V5 (12th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs BLG (11th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 2nd**

**Lowest Finish: 4th**

This team is in quite an unfortunate situation, losing one of the best rookies due to the matchfixing scandal and having to play with an academy jungler that went pro 2 months ago. Nonetheless, their team is extremely strong and should pick up easy wins against V5 and BLG. Their standing will depend on their winning margin but because of their current record, it is almost impossible for them to finish 1st.

**5th -** &gt;!JD Gaming (12-4, GD: +14)!&lt;

vs LNG (9h) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs LGD (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs OMG (14th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 5th**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

Despite their early inconsistencies, this team is a strong team, and in combination with their easy schedule, this team should end up 5th. There shouldn't be much discussion but it's possible that they drop a game and fall to 7th but they should sit comfortably at 5th.

**6th -**&gt;!Rare Atom (12-4, GD +12)!&lt;

vs RNG (1st) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs EDG (2nd) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 4th**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team is in an interesting situation, because they technically could end up 2nd if they 2-0 both of their games against the top 2 teams (atm). Before their 1-2 loss against LGD, RA was on a 7 win streak and almost all Chinese streamers/casters thought that they were at least top 2, or even the best, in LPL. This team was in discussion of whether or not they can finish 1st, but after their piss poor performance against LGD and their terrible game differential, the highest they could finish is 4th, and that requires extreme luck from the other top teams to lose/win games in their favour.

**7th -** &gt;!Team WE (11-5, GD: +11)!&lt;

vs BLG (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs EDG (2nd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs TES (3rd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 7th** 

This team being here is probably a shocker, especially after their 5-0 start to the split, but if they can't beat either EDG or TES, they'll most likely be 7th (unless JDG throws). With such a young and new roster, no matter what place they end they'll probably be happy with it and aim to improve to make it to worlds this year. They theoretically can make it to 1st, but that would require them to beat EDG and TES, and RNG to win against TES or RA, which is quite unlikely. Possible, but unlikely.

TL:DR

Week 10 will be an absolute blood bath, where a single team could change every team's ranking in the top 7. EDG and RNG will be extremely like to be top 3, but apart from that literally **anything** could happen. It is theoretically possible for anyone to finish 1st and also anyone to finish 7th. If you have time, watch some of the matches I mentioned at the beginning, you'll see high level league of legends alongside likely throws and ints by each team.

I'll also make one for the playoffs race but it's definitely not as exciting as the top seven.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7molx,TES and JDG: Thrones Reclaimed in the LPL,"**A Renewed Rise**

After some underperforming finishes for both Top Esports and JD Gaming at last year’s 2020 World Championship, many eyes were on these two mostly unchanged rosters to once again dominate the 2021 LPL in the same fashion that defined the previous year. Such expectations however, felt off. By the end of Week 5, halfway through the LPL, it seemed as if both of the titans had hit a hard wall; TES sat in 11th place, humbled by a loss even to the 17th place Rogue Warriors - with that series still being the only series RW has won in 2021 - and JDG similarly struggling to step into form, being dealt tough losses from other contenders EDG, IG, and a subpar-form TES. 

Yet, as it stands coming into the final stretch of LPL regulation, both teams are looking to once again shove their weight into deep playoff runs. How did such a bleak outlook halfway through the season turn into such hope only 4 weeks later? 

**The Die with Nine Faces, and the Frontline ADC**

Top Esports was a team that nobody expected to be in the place they were. Starting out the gate with a 3-3 record, many began to question the viability of the roster, particularly the spot of toplaner Bai “369” Jiahao. A player frequently meme’d as rolling a three, six, or a nine on the day, the early stretch of the split saw him consistently hit the lowest end of the trifecta, worrying many fans that the cohesion of the squad might be in jeopardy. 

However, when the team needed nines the most, 369 would make sure to deliver. Starting from that 3-3 position, he would go on to not just roll onto nines, but also roll OVER many of the opposing toplaners he would face, pushing TES onto a 7 series win streak and securing himself 7 MVPs - tying him for the 3rd highest in the league with the likes of Viper and Wei. 

Meanwhile at bot lane, Yu ""JackeyLove"" Wenbo continued his trademark flash-in, brave playing style which netted a large portion of teamfight wins. The constant dishing out damage, kiting, and fancy footwork noticeably returned to legendary status over recent weeks. Off the backs of both 369 and JackeyLove, Top Esports would go on to inflict crippling blows to the contending EDG and storied IG - and are once again looking to cement themselves as a cornerstone of the LPL.

**The Slow Start Squad Zooms Forward**

For those who follow the LPL closely, JDG’s start should not come as a huge surprise. They are a team well known at this point for being plagued with early season issues; in 2020 Spring they started out 5-4 before finishing 12-4, and in 2020 Summer they would start out to a 9th placed 3-2, only to finish 12-3.

This split is no different. Starting out 2-3, the squad now finds themselves 9-4, and on the road to contesting in the race to a top 2 finish. Powered by yet another rock in the toplane, the tenacity of Zhang “Zoom” Xingran gave JDG the time and space required to iron out the issues plaguing the rest of the roster, particularly in the botlane. Sitting at six MVP awards, much higher than any other member of JDG, this high class roster is searching for yet another repeat of their LPL title, and is hungry for another chance to prove themselves internationally.",leagueoflegends

Just had a quick look at the LPL now that LCS and LEC are finished, and why are IG 10th place?

Has TheShy been running it down harder than normal?

Like I went back and watched a few of the IG series, and it just looks to me like the whole team has no idea what they are doing really... XUN looks okay but their communication looks bad and even Rookie is looking suspect.

Their last 2 series are against V5 and LGD, so hopefully they can still get an easy playoffs, but man is it disappointing seeing a world champion a few years ago reduced to this.

t3_m89rlm,Question on how to deal with a team composition.,"Hi all,

As in the tag above, I got done with a game against a comp that I really don’t know how you can play against. I’ve been thinking of any strategy and can’t find one that works in theory, but I’m sure someone will know.

Enemy comp was

Top - Renekton

Jungle - Skarner

Mid - Malzahar

Bottom - Ashe

Support - Leona

They have a combined 15+ seconds of hard CC and I just don’t really see a way to beat it. I’d love to get some ideas just to expand my knowledge. I definitely should have dodged it in solo que.

Thanks in advance!


Edit - After having a night to think about it I came up with a few ideas for team comps to go against it but still would like to get some feedback on my ideas.

I feel that a team with really good front to back fighting with catch champions that has a hyper carry ADC like Jinx, Kog, Twitch, or Vayne would be the way to go. Something that can tank the initial engage from Renek, Leona, and Skarner and keep the ADC protected. A few champs in each role.

Top - Morde, Sion, Nasus, Poppy

Jungle - Hecarim, Warwick, Mundo, Sejuani

Mid - Galio, Swain, Morgana, Veigar

Bot - Jinx, Kog, Twitch, Vayne

Support - Thresh, Alistar, Janna, Taric

I feel like you could go with a more aggresive mid jungle combo as well to just try and destroy the skarner and malz pre 6 as well but that seems like a much more high risk high reward style, and harder to pull of than a comp like this.

t3_m7xes3,Why are Top Lane Matchups so 1 sided?,"I know this seems like a silly question at first glance, however, hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've bounced around playing a few different roles over the last 6-7 years, not only trying to have fun, but also climb the elo ladder.  I recently was moved to the Top Lane on a competitive team after moving from ADC as I used to main top a few seasons ago.  I don't know if this is a new thing, as I don't remember it being as terribly one sided, but the counter picks seem so heavy in one direction compared to other lanes.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I go and look at my match history and check which games I was fortunate enough to not have to first pick top (before they pick their top laner), my winrates are relatively high.  However, whenever I have to first pick my champion in Solo-Q, my winrate moves down to nearly 20%.  It feels that if you get counter-picked top lane, you actually can not play the game.  You are expected to either be 2 levels down and down 50 CS at 10 minutes, or you just perma-int if you actually try to fight.  The only exception I've found is just when playing tanks.  Why are these matchups so skewed in one direction? It makes playing and even practicing top lane such a chore.  I loved playing other roles, however, I'm finding myself truly hating the game as I play Top Lane.",leagueoflegends
t3_m7zka2,Is anyone else seeing this?,,leagueoflegends
t3_m8neax,"Untargetability is bad, and here’s why.","  

It’s a cheap outplay mechanic. It’s unhealthy for the game and unhealthy to balance.

Truth be told, This mechanic Only exist because point and click spells exist, but in the long run, the majority of the game is ran by skillshot champs, making Untargetability a very powerful tool even When not needed.

I know that people will mostly say that you can basically retaliate them after They do that, but by the time They used that, They already did what They wanted to do (Ekko and Zed already used their Ults for example).

Not Only that, but the player does not need toc are too Much about the Enemy’s most importante spells and just go all in without any care.

Take Zed as an example:  If you are facing Against him, you need to wait for him to come to you and use his ult before you can atack him. While It’s fine in paper (and you may even feel that), what I want to say is that, there’s no way to prevent that from happening. 

As a player, it’s fine for you to say that. As a design perspective. You should give the player an action to prevent it (Zhonyas can be the answer here, but, what if it’s an Immoble ADC? Don’t count sup here, or Others), and not after the Zed has already done his action and already damaging the player.

In a 3x3 or TF situation, it can be far worse as a Zed can simply run down everyone and target the Enemy priority target and run Away. Instead, he should of wait for all the oponent’s skills to be on CD and Only after that enter and try to assassinate the target and run.

The champions that has it have no excuse to have it.

Besides Yuumi (I’m not a Yuumi main, and I despise that Champion). All Other Champions that have this kinda of mechanic of are not so weak or can do what They are suposed to do even without it. Yi, Kayn, Vlad, Eve, Viego, Camille, Kled, Ekko, Elise, Lissandra, Xayah and Yuumi. Viego being the one who can be most ofended since his passive works on it, but instead of na untarget mechanic, he could just earn damage reduction for the time being soa t least the Enemy team has a chance to kill him off before he can transform and turn the table around.

Yuumi is kinda hard because her entire kit is around this mechanic, so, for her and her Only (since she’s actually the weakest Champion with no offensive power to kill you) this mechanic can apply, but with a major drawback of shared dmg Where part of the DPS that the Enemy applies to her host also goes for her a bit, meaning that she’d need to actually unbind from the host in order for her to heal herself, putting that spell on CD and giving more window for the Enemy player to atack.

Before that. The question is: Is the player (whose play those champions) so unable to actually play them or not do what They need to do without this mechanic? Can’t They really on their abilities themselves instead of the game having to allow it to them throught the removal of the champion’’s hitbox?",leagueoflegends
t3_m8lu4f,Nasus Gameplay Rework Concept (In-Depth):,"**Introduction:**

We are 6 patches into season 11, and Nasus has done *alright*. He struggled towards the beginning of the patch but with his Q cooldown buff and build optimization, he's sort of evened out and reached a similar level of power to last season. However, with the game continuing to change, it becomes more and more apparent that Nasus has an outdated kit. He *is* 10 years old, after all. With that in mind, I've worked on a concept for a gameplay rework. I used Riot's modern philosophy for reworks for the dog, taking the important gameplay elements of Nasus and carrying them over while modernizing them.

**TL;DR:**

Nasus' passive now works much like current Gargoyle's, granting bonus resistances per champion per second in combat, maxing after 5 seconds, along with health regeneration. His Q still stacks but is now a series of empowered attacks with the final hit gaining bonus damage scaling with bonus health. He gains additional empowered attacks every 250 stacks. His point-and-click slow has been changed into a skill shot that slows and expands into a circle at max range (or upon recast), granting an additional slow and grounding. Spirit Fire, (now called Soul Inferno) his E, is essentially the same but now grants bonus attack speed to Soul Sunderer (his empowered Q autos) while Nasus is inside. It also grants bonus tower damage. The Jackal, his ultimate, also stays almost the same but the bonus HP and resistances are weaker early but spike hard at 16. It also grants him 50 bonus attack range. 

**Passive: The Wandering Ascended**

Nasus gains 0.2-1%(scaling with level) bonus resistances per second per champion in combat, maxing out at 10-25% while gaining 100-250%(+25% per 100 AP) base health regen after 5 seconds in combat (the bonus regen will proc even with 1 champion).

Explanation: For most of us, the big draw of playing the dog is being a whole raid boss. So, I've given Nasus a better in-built tool to do so, while also encouraging him to take longer fights during laning phase, creating more interaction. The percentage increase gives a greater emphasis to building tankier items along with meshing with his ultimate.

**Q: Soul Sunderer**

Passive: Nasus gains 10-20% lifesteal. (10%/12%/14%/16%/20%)

Active: Nasus empowers his next 2 attacks, dealing 10-70(+Soul Sunderer Stacks) bonus damage. The final empowered attack deals 10-30(+1-5% bonus HP). Nasus heals for 100% of this bonus damage. If any of the attacks kill its target, Nasus gains 2/3/3/4/5 stacks based on the ability's level. These values are doubled against large minions, champions, and monsters. Every 250 stacks, Nasus gains another empowered attack. Cooldown begins after the last attack. On-hit effects only apply to the final empowered attack.

Bonus stacks: 2/3/3/4/5

Lifesteal: 10%/12%/14%/16%/20%

Cooldown: 9/7.5/6/5/4.5

Cost: 35 mana

Explanation: In this iteration of Nasus, his Q and stacks are still his bread and butter. I've moved his lifesteal passive to his Q, much like Viego's bonus damage. I made the decision to make his Q bonus damage proc on multiple attacks to also encourage longer trades in lane. On-hit effects proccing only on the last hit may seem odd, but it shouldn't hurt your stacking too much as every empowered hit will grant stacks, not just the last one. However, I've had to decrease his overall stack gains per target as it is easier to greed for stacks (EX: Nasus can now greedily stack a melee minion under his tower knowing he can use the other hits to stack the dying cannon). I've also neglected to add any AD ratios much like his current Q and even added a bonus HP ratio to continue to push him towards building tankier items after his main sheen item. The heal is also a risk-and-reward system. Much like Morde's old 3 hit Q, Nasus could use the 1st attacks of his Q on minions and use the final attack to get the healing along with the bonus damage at the cost of potentially pushing his wave and breaking his prized freeze. Or, he could take the long trade and risk getting chunked for better damage. Of course, base damage has gone down as there are multiple attacks. The same thing applies to the cooldown and mana cost.

**W: Crippling Sand**

Nasus sends a line of energy through the ground making the area it passes unsteady, slowing for 35%. After being recast early or reaching maximum range, it expands into a circle of shifting sands, slowing for an additional 15% and grounding. Champions caught in the shifting sands for 2 seconds have their attack speed reduced by 30%. The line of the unsteady ground and the circle last for 2.5 seconds.

Cooldown: 12 seconds

Cost: 90 mana

Explanation: His W is probably the most problematic part of his current kit. Currently, he has a point-and-click slow that gets up to a 95% slow along with decreasing attack speed by up to 50%. While it is very good for catching up to people, Nasus doesn't really have much issue getting to targets when he runs ghost (which you should almost always run because Nasus is a completely different champion with Ghost). Nasus' problem is getting kited, especially by uber-mobile champions (i.e. Vayne), and as League continues to see a mobility-creep Nasus will continue to have issues. Thus, I decided to make the slow less-crippling but adding a grounding effect. You'll also notice that the ability is described as a skill shot, which can be recast to create the larger slowing and grounding effect. It just gives a bit more skill-expression while preventing a need for some type of mobility.

**E: Soul Inferno**

Nasus ignites a soul flame on a target area, dealing 40-200(+65% AP). The circle of flames lasts for 5 seconds, dealing 15-50(+10% AP) per second. Enemies inside have their armor negated by 20-40%. This effect lasts for 1 second upon the ability's end or leaving its area. If Nasus is inside of the circle, he gains 10-30% attack speed during Soul Sunderer. Soul Sunderer also deals 10% bonus adaptive damage to turrets while Nasus is inside.

Cooldown: 15/14/13/12/10

Cost: 75/90/110/120/125

Initial Damage: 40/85/125/165/200

Damage per second: 15/25/35/40/50

Bonus Attack Speed: 10%/15%/20%/25%/30%

Negated Armor: 20%/25%/30%/35%/40%

Explanation: I've kept his E essentially the same, just rounding out some of its damage numbers and allowing its cooldown to scale along with some of its numbers, creating a power spike upon maxing. When I mentioned that Nasus would have tools to take longer trades and capitalize on the bonus damage and healing on the last hit of his Q this is what I meant. The attack speed allows him to get those attacks off more quickly, encouraging Nasus to fight in his E instead of only using it to poke or last-hit from range. I've also pushed Nasus to more split pushing by increasing his tower damage while inside. Most times, you're clearing waves and hitting the tower in your E anyway.

**R: The Jackal**

Nasus imbues himself with the powers of the sands, gaining HP and resistances while growing in size for 15 seconds. During this time, Soul Sunderer gains an extra empowered attack and has it's cooldown reduced by 20%. Nasus also deals magic damage around him based on enemies' maximum health. He also gains 50 attack range.

Cooldown: 130 seconds

Cost: 110 mana

Bonus HP: 250/400/700

Bonus Resistances: 15/30/60

Explanation: His ultimate is also essentially the same. I've reduced the HP and resistances gain earlier while having him spike *hard* at 16. I've also granted him a bonus empowered attack during his ultimate and granting the bonus range he's lost from my iteration of his Q. I had to decrease the cooldown decrease to prevent him from having his empowered attacks up for every auto.

**Conclusion:**

If you've read all of my rambling, thank you! While I was conceptualizing this rework, thoughts of *""Overloaded!""* filled my head, and it's totally possible that my idea is overloaded, but I think I've budgeted his power in a way that doesn't turn him into a 200-year dog. One of my main objectives was preventing Nasus from having some of the hallmarks of *less-desirable* modern Riot design. Things like additional mobility and paragraph-long passives come to mind. I think I've managed to create a relatively simple, versatile kit that holds onto the fantasy of Nasus. All numbers are of course, subject to change and are pretty amateurly-made. After all, I just based them on his current numbers, changing them as I saw fit. Let me know if you think this is too much, too little, or completely off the mark. I want my dog to continue to succeed in League of Legends for years to come.",leagueoflegends

I personally think a mana item with armor, MR and % health based on mana would be sweet. Maybe similar to gargoyles but mana ratio instead of shield. 

This would give mana hungry tank/bruisers a starter item path but it would be finished later into a well rounded tanky item.

Still a great skin though, that recall is incredible.

t3_m83os5,Amateur League with variety of prizes for Silver-Gold and Plat-D4 players," Hey!

I will be organizing an amateur League for players from EUW/EUNE and NA all details can be found below.

**Tournament Rules**

There will be two separate leagues. Teams will be drafted randomly from a pool of the available players. The size of the tournament will depend on the number of available players.

**Rewards**

For the winners of the tournament:

* 25$ RP for each participant
* Free BE smurfs
* Free coaching session live or replay review for each participant.

For the 2nd place:

* Free BE smurfs
* Free coaching session live or replay review for each participant.

For the 3rd &amp; 4th place:

* Free BE smurfs

The final 4 teams will be assigned a professional coach

**Requirements to join**

In order to prevent smurfs from disrupting the tournament following requirements must be met to join.

* At least level 100 account
* Prior ranked experience in the last 3 years
* Clash participants will have priority in joining, because of verified phone number.

We reserve the right to remove any player that is obviously not in the elo he claimed to be.

**Leagues**

We will organize two separate leagues but this might change in the feature depending on the engagement.

* Silver 4 to Gold 1
* Platinum 4 to Diamond 4

**Progression of the tournament**

The tournament isn't simply supposed to reveal which team is the best. Instead, we want to create a competitive environment that promotes learning and we believe that building a community of fellow students is the best way to do that.

**That's why our tournament will consist of two stages:**

Learning stage during which teams scrim against each other for 2 weeks and have a game of their choice reviewed by a coach once a week. We will also answer your questions in the chat if you have any.

Tournament during which teams play in double round-robin if there are 10 teams per league or single round-robin if there are more than 10 teams. Semifinalists will be assigned a permanent coach for the remaining part of the tournament.

If you want to join the tournament please click the link below:

t3_m7g860,"New Voice Lines For Zyra, Written By Me","Zyra is in a fairly awkward, but not necessarily unique position among the League roster. Like many other champions, her model, VFX, and lore are all up to date, or at the very least passable. However, what keeps her and many other champions from being entirely modern is the extensive voice lines reworked and newer champions have. What does make Zyra's situation a bit more nuanced is that her current voice over by no means conflicts with her lore like other older champions, mostly because it's all just generic empty lines relating to plants. So, I'm really only adding special interaction lines, such as with champions, objectives, kills, etc.

With Zyra, in lore she's portrayed as this untamed seductress, like a sexy venus flytrap for lack of a better example, luring you in with beautiful flowers and intoxicating aromas, only to unleash her fury the moment she has you. With that in mind, when writing these I was trying to get on that fine line where she wouldn't sound to much like LeBlanc or Evelynn, League's other resident seductresses. I also wanted to capture this sort of hunter/predator aspect she's always had, displaying that wild hunger that has carried through her characterization as nature's wrath. Most importantly, I wanted her to sound distinct from Poison Ivy of DC Comics, a character she may as well be a parody of, so I also attempted to incorporate how truly ancient and alien is.

For anybody who isn't up to date with the current iteration of her lore or is unaware of it, here's the link to her universe page,  [https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en\_US/champion/zyra/](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/zyra/)

""Wet soil holding me, nourishing me, sunlight invigorating me, no, not just me, all of us, the roots everywhere, a web, connection, I.. I.. I used to be more, far and wide.""

""Pain, wet, sore, thorns around my ankles, the men are screaming, mind racing, 'I will not fall like this! This isn't how I die!' \**gasps\** The woman, the catalyst.""

""Feeding, growing, spreading, there is only one path and it will never end, never be enough. Not until I'm everywhere.""

t3_m8deh8,Battle Academia Event Pass,"Heyho

I was wondering, if there is going to be a Battle Academia Event Pass like there was with the Lunar Event?

Normally when releasing a Prestige Skin, they also have the Token System, as well as an Event Pass, so you can buy it for 2000 Tokens. (Right now Fiora, for example)

Well, i was really hyped, when i saw, that my main Leona was getting a prestige skin and now that she is realeased, i realised, that i can only buy her through prestige points and not tokens...

I dont have unlimited money, so i only invest a little bit now and then. An event pass would be within my budget, but if i'd now have to invest in the prestige points themself, i would have to spend over 100€. Thats way over my budget...

I think its unfair, that some prestige skins can be bought with little money and a lot of play time, and some just with loads of money...

What do you think?   
Would there be other options?  
I guess i could wait for the next event, buy the pass, get the prestige points and buy her then, but that seems so unlogical to me...",leagueoflegends
t3_m8a5a8,There are currently no good Mana items for Bruisers and no good Grievous Wound magic resist items for Tanks who are up against healing ap damage.,"**Currently, if you are a bruiser (ap or ad), you literally have no good items you can build to help you get more mana.** Triforce no longer gives mana, Lichbane no longer gives mana.

Literally the only items that give mana is Frozen heart, which is a very niiche (and understat) tank item. 

**And if you want magic resist and mana as a bruiser or a tank, you don't have any option to do so.** (having mana used to mean something, now it feels like a huge disadvantage when we have fking manaless champs everywhere)

Banshee's stopped giving mana ages ago, abyssal helm no longer gives mana and is absolute trash. Heck most magic resist items that aren't mythic items or Gargoyle's Stoneplate are absolute trash

**And for Tanks who are fighting  healing AP damage, you have nothing to defend yourselves with.**

If you are facing Cassiopiea, or Sylas, or Vlad, or Swain, you're pretty fucked. They just heal off abilities and don't auto you and theres nothing you can do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bramble's Vest should build from an HP crystal and inflict Grievous Wounds if you are hit by an auto or a single target ability (or skill shot that affects a single target)

Then it should split off into two items, one which is thornmail and the other which is magic resist thornmail equivalent that grants grevious wounds if you are in combat with said champion for more than 4 or 5 seconds.

Abyssal helm and Force of Nature should also not be complete trash and be buffed efficiency wise and statwise.",leagueoflegends
t3_m8i293,NALCS - Need to Address Scrim Dodging for Pros - Sources and Solutions,"Good Morning League of Legends players. This is a post to challenge the current NALCS scrim culture and why it is bad, and needs to stay in the community spotlight so teams have to address it. I was actually shocked that teams in NA are dodging scrims if they do not like the draft as per Alphari's interview with Travis. Additionally we can see on the recent Dive episode Azael and Kobe confirmed that teams will run it down if someone plays off meta mid picks.

Compare the fact that not one team owner acknowledged this when they said ""Lift the Import restrictions"".

These are two different topics but I think they tie together. Owners like Regi are making excuses to pull in more international talent to be more competitive with other regions, but if they say they are developing NA Talent, why are we not allowing players to be challenged or creatives in scrims?

A culture where being different, thinking outside the box, and playing through poor drafting is all discouraged, will cause failure on stage. Not to give TSM a hard time specifically but as an example, almost every time they go to international tournaments they fail, and the reason is they are not practicing off meta or facing it in scrims or rarely in regular season/playoffs. I could, as a gold solo que player, guess their drafts with about a 65% accuracy in INTL worlds tourneys, imagine the opposing teams?

Our region has been slow and safe for too long, C9 proved in 2018 that you have to be experimental, you have to be aggressive, and have to pick unorthodox to defeat your opponents, the problem, is, we basically killed that mentality the following seasons. The removal of Reapered as coach because players were uncomfortable with his drafting, the truth is, the region held back his crazy drafting to get wins.

If people had to face these wild comps in scrims, people would learn new things more often. Since I am not a pro I can't speak up from experience, but Alphari already has, at least enough to say, NA scrim dodging is NOT NORMAL. Worst major region and scrim dodging might not be a direct correlation, but it could be part of the problem.

If NALCS really truly wants to get better for international, it's time to stop saying LOL PING and PLAYERBASE, it's time to change the way we scrim instead of checking a box.

P.S. I think 3 games per week and a opener tourney was a positive change for regional growth, as at least unorthodox drafts may develop on stage regular season slightly more often.",leagueoflegends

I am currently in low masters on NA (~100LP) and can't duo. That's not a big issue for me, but it becomes extremely frustrating when I go against D1 duos several games in a row. In theory that might seem fair, but oftentimes the duo will have an 80% winrate and the players will be as skilled as if not moreso than I am on an individual level, which leads to me getting crushed easily by their coordination as a solo mid player.

t3_m6vpzj,Alphari has finished the split with possibly the highest gold differential at 10 minute in LCS history,"Obviously this only includes players who played a full (or even nearly full) split. After 18 games, Alphari's GD10 is [+493](https://oracleselixir.com/stats/players/byTournament/LCS%2F2021%20Season%2FSpring%20Season). To put this in perspective for this split, the second highest top laner is Finn with +35, and the second highest at any position is Huhi with +313.

Of players who played the entire split, the next highest GD10 that I can find **at any position** was Blaber in summer of 2020 at +370. For most splits, the highest was a little over +300. Unfortunately, Oracleselixir only has complete stats going back to summer of 2014, so it's possible that someone on Cloud 9 in summer of 2013 did better given how dominant they were.

Alphari's CSD10 is second highest in LCS history (excluding supports) at +12.5, topped only by Huni in spring of 2016 at +13.1. An absolutely insane split from Alphari.",leagueoflegends

ADC players are the most wonderful, non-toxic people who need to be rewarded by this community by endless compassion. Even if Jinx ends up with 700 base HP by 2025, the role will still be weak. But you know which role's a problem? Junglers. I took 0 effort to study their pathing to avoid ganks, but it doesn't mean they should be coming to my lane and interfering with my Yasuo mechanics. Jungle champions have appeared on nerf list 23 times over past 5 patches and XP got nerfed, which is not the reason why it's autofilled so much- jungle will never be weak, even if it is.

Riot expects people to not be toxic and then makes them toxic but spitting at em with stuff like that LMAO

After you get ganked as top laner, 0 wards when you knew the enemy jungler was leashed by bot lane then proceed to question mark your jungler 3 times and “ff” in the chat. How does that look to your team? They think you are tarzaning and darn sure serious about giving up, and 30% of the time you are, 70% of the time you’re too pro to accept your fault, and 100% of the time your team thinks it’s the 30%.

If you are those people who drink beer through a straw and genuinely think a game is over after that, please realize, this is league of legends. A game that has lasted over 10 years, hundreds of patch changes and millions of games with comebacks. Even doublelift could come back in his career (3x), are you seriously giving up after your own fault in 5 minutes after you spent 5 minutes in queue and champ select?

* ***Darius*** \- leaps and does increasing true damage based on number of bleed stacks up to 5, kill will fear/slow surrounding minions and grant 5 stacks of bleed. There is no indicator. Re-casts cost no mana and ult is available for 20 seconds. At rank 3 mana cost is removed and kills fully reset CD. The area around target is revealed for 2.5 sec, his ult requires a target.
* ***Pyke*** \- marks, strikes and blinks to an area, which executes (deals true damage to) enemies under a certain amount of health, dealing 50% as physical AOE to other enemies. Additionally split gold with allies and recast at no cost (initial is 100 mana). Partial damage applies if target is not under threshold. Has an indicator to tell you when to ult, requires no target
* ***Viego*** \- gains displacement immunity, then blinks to a location, dealing AOE damage which also scales off crit. It knocks back all enemies but 1 (either the lowest health target or closest), whom receives bonus damage based off their missing health, is slowed by  99% for .5 sec, and receives an application of all on hit effects. When Viego posses a soul he becomes untargetable for 1 second, blinks a second time to the soul's location, and heals for a minimum of 8% target's maximum hp.  There is a 1.5 second delay between ult resets. There is no indicator, ult does not require a target or any mana at all levels.

t3_m78j4w,"I genuinely think that the game would be better if everyone would be permanently ""chat restricted""","What I mean by that is that everyone should always have limited messeges they can send, just like when you are chat restricted. It could be something like:

* Maximum messeges: 3. Start with 3. Gain an additional message: every 60 seconds.
* Or maximum messeges: 5. Start with 3. Gain an additional message: every 120 seconds.

Currently, games turn into flame fest really fast, for example, top and jungler or bot lane flaming each other. All it takes is someone type something negative, then the other person gets triggered and never ending flaming cycle begins. It feels like 90% of all messeges typed in chat are actually someone flaming each other or spamming ""FF15"" every time they die and only 10% are something positive / useful. Overall, this not only makes them perform worse because they are too busy typing but also drops morale of whole team.

**And please, don't tell me ""juST diSAblE CHat""** or **""/muTE aLL"".** This doesn't help, when I'm not the one participating in it, I can't stop my teammates playing ***Keyboard Warriors*** instead of ***League of Legends.*** The best thing I can do is say ""Please calm down and play"" but most of the time that doesn't help, sometimes it even makes it worse...

If everyone would have limited messeges, they just couldn't non-stop flame even if they wanted to. For non-toxic players, it wouldn't change much, because they wouldn't waste messeges flaming, so they'd have enough of them whenever they need it.

TL;DR: Just read the title.

**EDIT** (I just woke up and after reading all comments, I decided to address a few most common replies)**:**

* The amount of toxic replies in this post only proves that most people in this community are just toxic and fast to insult, rather than actually trying to have a healthy conversation.
* Most of the people reply after reading the title only and say ""counter-arguements"" that I have already addressed in my post. **I'LL REPEAT MYSELF:**
   * No, I'm not a thin skinned person and yes, I know where to find mute buttons but what if I told you that it doesn't stop my teammates from typing! Did you know that?!
* The only good counter-arguement is that people like to time summoner's spells in chat. However, I never said that this idea is 100% perfect and has no flaws. Obviously, it should be adjusted. For example, you would have higher messeges limit / have them recharge more quickly but every time you get reported, it would reduce this limit / recharge time. **THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM BECAUSE** currently, if you don't say any trigger words, you'll probably never gonna get chat restricted, meanwhile, with this system, annoying people who spam ""ff15"", ""go next"" and so on, would often get reported and punished. Meanwhile, people who rarely or never get reported, they have plenty of messeges for all their needs.
* Following my previously point, yes, I can agree that my suggestion was a bit too extreme but my main point is to increase the amount of people having unlimited access to the chat.
* **For people saying ""If they couldn't chat, they would just run it down instead or grief you in other ways""**. If the player is non-stop typing, he's already griefing. Quite often I see people dying while typing, not even to mention that the person is distracted and not thinking about how to win the game because he's too busy thinking of a creative way to insult other person. Moreover, most people won't hardcore grief because they actually care about their precious LP, meanwhile, as I already said, they actually grief by non-stop chatting without even realising it.
* **FOR PEOPLE SAYING ""imAGinE RedUCinG ChaT In cOMpeTItiVE TEam GAme"".** Just ask yourself, how often does anyone say something useful in the chat?! Because I see that like 1 useful messege per 5 minutes...

Due to the LPL skipping 11.4 entirely in pro play, I will say that this post is pretty weak. The LCK were using 11.4 through last week, and began on 11.5 today. 

I am staying true to posting each patch, regardless of the amount of material though. ( I already can say there are more for 11.5). There were only three individual champion matchups that occurred more than 10 times. I give some stats on those as I normally do, with win rates in pro vs win rates in solo queue. Lastly, I did include matchups that were the most common at each role without stats,  even if they did not play 10 times.

As I say every patch, there are countless variables that effect these statistics. These are based on win rates in a vacuum.

He left behind his alienation and torment in his homeland in seek of a power that would allow him to be respected once more. On his journey across Demacia he encounters a being of pure faith and truth, or so he says. This being agrees to give Stauf courage and strength greater than that of any man, in exchange, this being requests a strange thing. His death. Confused, Stauf looks up at the being, only to notice it’s eyes were now open. Eyes of raw hatred, belonging to a Darkin. 
Stauf screams in agony as the Darkin gouges out his eyes, replacing them with his own. “You will  see nothing but mortals falling at your gaze...”
... Stauf stirs awake. Darkness. As if he entered the void. Anger. Zen. Fear. Confidence. What was he feeling? Even he could not tell. As he looked around he noticed a being passing by, engulfed in a bright orange flame. A person? King? Peasant? Good? Evil? He could not tell. “Serve your purpose...” It echoed in his mind. He could not deny.  He sprinted towards the flame, faster than any living creature could possibly move, slamming it to the ground. “Gaze, into your own hell...” 

Passive - Behold, The Darkin

(AD, MR, and Armor increase per level)

Stauf is empowered by the spirit of the Darkin, craving battle and carnage. Stauf gains a stack every time he is damaged by  or damages a champion, giving him AD and Armor based on how many stacks he has (max 5 stacks, expiring after 8 seconds out of combat) Upon reaching 5 stacks, the Darkin gives all his might into his next attack, dealing bonus damage and applying lifesteal based on how fast Stauf acquired the stacks of Behold, The Darkin. After he attacks, the stacks are reset and put on a 3 second cooldown.

Q - Abhorrence

(CD 12/10.5/9/7.5/6)
(Damage 30/50/70/90/130 75%AD)

Stauf lashes out in disgust, damaging and slowing enemies in a reverse cone (think cone hitbox, but with the wide end closer to Stauf, thinking about same range as Galio Q) applying lifesteal at 50% effectiveness and marking enemies he hit. If the marked enemy is hit by Oblivion, repeat this abilities damage and slow onto the target.

W - Take the Wheel

CD 20/20/20/20/0

Stauf allows the Darkin to take over, gaining range and additional damage on his abilities, but draining his health over the duration. Stauf loses 10% move speed for the duration of the effect. 

W Passive - The Darkin is furious that enemies dare to damage him, gaining onmivamp based on how long he is in combat. This onmivamp is reset when Behold, The Darkin is reset. However, this passive has no cooldown upon reset.

E - Oblivion 

(CD 17/15.5/14/12.5/11)
(Damage 80-120/90-140/100-180/110-220/120/260)
(Damage to self if 50% of these base values)

Stauf locks in place, charging for 0.5 to 2 seconds, dealing damage to himself based on how long he held the charge. At the end of the duration, he transforms into smoke, instantaneously blinking to a target location dealing damage. This damage is increased based on damage dealt to himself. This ability’s cool down is reduced by 70% after cast if it hits a target marked by [Q]

R - Mark of the Damned

(CD 190/145/100)
(Stun Duration .25/.35/.5)

Stauf spins in a circle forcing all nearby champions to look into his eyes, stunning them for .25 seconds, marking them, Stauf them summons a copy of every marked opponent with 125% attack speed, and +10% movement speed. These copies receive 150% of their normal damage and deal 75% of their normal damage. These copies will then auto

t3_m8c7s0,how mentally old do you think low Elo players are?,"just had a game as nasus top. played pretty defensive. I had something like 1/2 against a 9/2 vayne top for the first 15 minutes. in those 15 minutes my jungler never helped me. he only went once top when i was dead. killed all minions, attacked tower and died to vayne. while the others i think tried to help protect the tower when i was in spawn, but they died even at 2v1 feeding vayne more. i never insulted the whole game or spammed the pings. i didn't talk for half the game. the only think i said was thank you for help when i saw a teammate standing on tower while i was fighting with yasuo, i was almost under tower. maybe if she helped me we could have gotten a kill and retreat before enemy came. 

near the end of the game people started being toxic pushing the blame on me. when the game was over they trash talked me and said report while EVEN the enemy team was defending me saying they cant blame me and its not my fault. I'm a bronze player, i know i could have done better but in that game i did play like a turtle trying to not feed and only attacking when i had backup. so idk why they would blame it at me. i dont think they were premade

i feel like 80% of the people find are kids that cant accept the fact that you cant always win.

t3_m89k2j,The new battle academia Caitlyn skin is sadly really underwhelming.,"Basically what the title says. So I get home from a long day of work and I'm super excited to buy and try out the new legendary Caitlyn skin and after one game I feel really let down. I don't know if it's because the quality of recent legendary skins has been so exceptional that the bar was set really high but battle academia Caitlyn really just feels like a glorified 1350rp skin. Don't get me wrong, the new emotes, home guard, and voice lines are cool but that's something that's just come to be expected with all 1820rp skins. Like when you really get down to it, the only things that make this skin even somewhat stand out as a legendary is the added anime overlay when ulting and the ""gun transformations"". And both of those are extremely underwhelming when thinking about other skins like Katarinas legendary skin and how your blade transformations are actually noticeably different and make your abilities different colors. Even the legendary Ezreal skin that came out tHree years ago has noticeable changes with his passive. Meanwhile, Caitlyn has three lousy gun transformations, that to be quite honest, aren't noticeable at all, and I've still yet to see them change abilities or autos in any way. And that just leaves the upgraded ult, which is admittedly kind of cool in theory, but considering the overlay lasts for approximately 1.5 seconds I don't see how it can justify this skin being worth 1820rp. I don't know, I might just be comparing this skin to other legendaries too much, but with all the recent legandaries I feel like the standards are just so much higher than what this skin delivered. Maybe if the gun transformations had noticeable impacts on the skin it would be totally worth it but I don't know. I'm curious to know what you guys think though, am I being overdramatic? 

tldr: Compared to other legendary skins battle academia Caitlyn is severely lacking",leagueoflegends

t3_m7pof9,Some calculations about the most money efficient way to collect all possible skin in League,"Hey guys, I believe currently there are 1184 skins out there, and I have 266 of them so far.  

I'm aware that re-rolling three skin sharps guarantee a new skin, and I got 200 unique shards right now. So I need  (1184-266)\*3 - 200 = 2554 skin shards in order to reach full collection. Hope my math is correct here.

I did a bit of calculation about the purchasing plans I have: 

&amp;#x200B;

So I used the most expensive bundle for each plan and calculated the unit price for the chest or orbs. The odds of getting a skin shard are from league wiki, I believe the odds are so but correct me if I'm wrong. So at first glance, buying orbs is the cheapest plan, it cost me around 4.2k.

Also, opening orbs has a 4% chance of getting a jackpot, and a jackpot has 3 shards for 70% of the time and 4 shards for the rest, so a reasonable expectation is an orb gives 1+0.04\*(3\*0.7+4\*0.3) = 1.132 shards. Also, buying a 50 orbs bundle gives a pack of 9 shards with 20 chance of 3 extra, with that averaged, the expectation of shards in an orb is 1.32, which's more than my expectation before calculation actually. So the final plan is:

I'm aware that buying all the skins that are below 750 RP at the store might help a bit if I prefer all orbs plan, there are around 70 skins that below 750RP which I haven't owned. I'm just trying to be lazy here haha.  

So is there any plan besides buying all cheap skins at the store, and purchase orbs until I re-rolled all the skins, that's cheaper? I would really appreciate any improvements to the current plan. I'm really curious about this, I have played league for about 8 years, and rarely done any purchases, it's just my childhood dream to have all the skins in the league LOL.",leagueoflegends

1. The teammates I get in Ranked- I like to think I'm a pretty decent League of Legends player. I'm currently s3 peaked s1 80lp. recently I have had a spike in games where I have had one or more teammates that just seems like they aren't playing to win. Which confuses me on how they are even in a game with me and 2 how are they not banned/ don't get banned after the game and I report them? If my Ezereal has 2 KP in a 30 min game and 8k damage obviously something is up. i just wish the matchmaking system was better because it is a team game and one player cant win the game for everyone.
2. The Toxicity in League Of Legends- The amount of times I've had jungle camps stolen, whole minion waves stolen by my jungler, my champs I'm hovering being banned by my teammates and so on is astounding to me. I report these people but I just can't seem to escape them. I really hope riot can figure out a way to get rid of toxic people.

How it works: For the teams, it is simple enough. Each team starts at an elo of 1500, and when they win games, they gain points, and when they lose, they lose points. The gains/losses are larger when there is a larger rating gap between the teams.

Similar applies to the players scores - points are gained/lost based on the average elo score of the opponents faced.

It can take up to 15s to load the data as I'm performing some other calculations atm, but hopefully you enjoy.

push the 2nd wave and hit turret, get 1st plate if ur on botlane   
walk behind t1 turret and drag the cannon wave, do not hit it then just wait in bush near t2 turret until the bots arrive then kill the ezreal if ur bot or nasus if ur top    
if u can go for it kill the 2nd bot if not just walk to lane then perma push and go for kills whenever u can   
once u recall get vamp scepter and then u build this:

do quick tap W to reduce damage from towers   
you can basic attack reset with W   
dont use E before Q, use E instantly after you go out of Q

 I usually play defensive the first levels, especially if the enemy support has a wider range than me or the ability to grab, but the Ezraels I met are always angered by this attitude and start trying to attack enemies and getting mad that it's all my fault for not hitting Q enough and my fault for them dying. Like some of them also started spamming me to leave the lane and I never understand if it would help them to get all the exp from the lane alone or if they're just being toxic.

t3_m7nta6,Question about jungle balance,"hi,

first of all I am not a jungle main, hence I ask.

So my question is about the constant ""jgl gap"" thing.

""gg jgl gap"" has been a huge and disgusting thing for 2 to 3 years now and it has been especially bad this season. Every second to third game is ""jgl gap"". The weird thing is, it has only become worse after the ""jungle nerfs"". I feel like after the jungle nerfs, the ""better"" jgl or the jgler, who had one more opportunity is just unstoppable, outlevels laners and the ""jgl gap jgler"" has 2-4 levels less than the ""better jungler"". I don't want to call out jungle players because I feel like this is not completely their fault. The ""better"" jgl just had one more opportunity (like 1 kill lead early game) and can snowball way too hard with it. In comparison, when somebody dies mid or bot, they have at least a chance to get back up or go even. In jungle the opportunity to come back is way to little. This also applies a bit to top lane I feel, a top laner dies once, and is out of the game, but at least top lane doesn't snowball as hard as jungle. I personally feel the current soloqueue jungle meta is very unhealthy for the game and the community, I may be wrong and this is why I want to ask. Was this always the case? Why is it like this? Can this be fixed? Am I just wrong?",leagueoflegends

I invite you to think of a single tank build that leaves a character more invulnerable to damage than the 3 items below when build one after the other:

Divine Sunderer + Black Cleaver + Sterak's Gage.

Can you do that? No. And why not? Because flat health will ALWAYS be a better tanking stat than armor and mr are. By the time you hit 3 items with a tank, unless their team has only one type of damage, you have already been forced to specialize in tanking either AD or AP and that leaves you helpless against the other type of damage.

Tanks will never come back to meta unless flat health is nerfed to being an off-tank stat instead of a immortal bruiser one.

t3_m82frx,"Make selling items less expensive, or allow swapping of mythics and legendaries.","With the new item reworks and focus on diversity I think it is time to buff selling items. Currently the return on selling items forces you to keep your build even if as time goes on a more optimal build is available. 

In my opinion this woukd fix alot of the issues I currently have with the system. You would have a lot of agency with itemizing to the most fed person, as well as being more experimental with different builds as you could back track if not working as ideal as you thought. 

Of course this would have some drawbacks, as you would itemize in lane much more effectively and then potentially just sell for the broader team play. The playtest team could see if this feels right, or whether it's just a balance with the amounts sound to make it not as oppressive. The other option that could be cool is the ability to pay a fee and swap within item categories, switch for a different mythic on the fly, or switch to the different legendary.

Thats enough on its own but he also has a history of featuring and promoting clips that contain racist sentiments and slurs on his videos.

Most recently a clip of that Thresh main with the budget corpse voice saying something racist while intentionally feeding a Lucian (episode 1151).

t3_m7wmy3,Best champion to one trick soloq,"Hello guys. I am playing League since season 2. I sometimes just stop playing for a few years then return to the game after that. I've just returned to the game 2 weeks ago and still there are things I don't know about the meta. I was playing top lane since I've started just because it seemed like the easiest lane where you just chill and farm and trade with your laner almost isolated since it is far from other lanes and the drake. And I know it is completely wrong. From now on I want to really ""play"" the games and see how high can I climb. But I need a champion to one trick and master my mechanics so I can dominate games even if my teammates don't do well. I want to play mid lane to affect the game more and I love playing Zed, Kassadin and Fizz. I need some recommendations from you guys to which champion to one trick so it gets me to plat-diamond. You don't have to choose one from the ones I've mentioned I just wanted to say that I like those champs.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7w1hd,can someone please tell me how to beat yuumi,"EDIT: ty for the tips! but i forgot to mention im a jungler!

ive always hated yuumi and permabanned her until she recieved few nerfs, but since s11 i dont remember winning a single game against this champion (and i want to know how to beat her without just permabanning her like i used to)

literally last game as a jungler i got a soul, 2 heralds and alot of succesful ganks (80%KP) and we were winning the game by alot, but enemy yuumi decided to jump from jhin over to a kinda behind eve and made her unkillable

this always happens when i play against her, no matter how hard we are winning, she always jumps on someone and transforms them into an unkillable beast, antiheals dont really work because her heals are too strong

she also gives so much AD/AP from her W (and staff of flowing water) and a shit ton of movement speed from her E so we cant really splitpush either

Do you think the reason I didn't go higher was because I didn't play with an unlocked camera? I tried a few times to play unlocked but it was awful af. For example: I played Draven with an unlocked camera and I missed my axes while farming.

Now that was just an example. I usually play melee champs. Is it that bad if I play with a locked camera? I unlock it only when I need (checking other lanes or the enemies before a gank / roam), but I ONLY fight and farm with my camera locked.

I feel like there is no chance for me to learn how to play with unlocked.

01. Is it that bad that I just can't play it unlocked?

02. Will I go higher in div if I unlock it or plat 2 is my max level?

Meanwhile our mid and myself (ADC) are like 2/0/0 or better. Seriously, was 4/0/0 on Vayne with a 20 CS lead, and 6/0/0 on Caitlyn with a 40 CS lead and they up and quit. If you are behind then learn how to give up farm (last hitting) and get experience by just hanging back until you can farm under turret. Seriously, the most valuable resource in the game is levels. At a certain point your laner will roam if all you do is turtle, and that gives my fed ass a chance to punish those roams while you absorb XP and that gold. You can even learn how to shove and deny gold by sacking it to their turret.

This season has been incredibly toxic to try to climb in because people are trolling or rage quitting by 5-8 minutes, and it is seriously no fun. If you get that angry that early into a game quit playing league altogether. Like if you are quitting that early how are you having any fun what so ever? Not only that but you are being selfish and inconsiderate towards those that actually try. Grow up and be a teammate or go play Roblox or Fortnite.

Please for the love of god learn to be patient and allow yourself to be carried. This is a valuable life lesson.

But instead they create something and say immadetly that it makes ""this"" and it's good for ""this"". Whenever some item or champion is played in a different way than intended, they nerf this as fast as possible and say ""It's toxic for a game"".

The game end with a teemo hard fed who oneshots me and aphelios with a q or 1 shroom, as i knew nasus in 30 minutes had only 200 stacks so yeah that wasn't a good game, the question is, is it right for a jungler to completely ignore a lane because of the matchup or because the champ scale?",leagueoflegends

Keep the representatives from less competitive leagues and still counting 4 ""major"" regions and with that also keep the competition less competitive with a super boring kinda time wasting play-in and group stages, or give the true strong regions much more seeds(LPL,LCK) to increase the level of play, hype and everything else.

t3_m7t390,"With 154 champions, what's the point of build diversity?","Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of situational items like serpents fang and verdant/seekers, but this making Xin able to play AP is something no one asked for.

The game is a lot easier to balance when every champions has a clear identity that is supported by a set of items. This weird ""let's create AP Xin jungle and AP twitch support"" stuff just gives the balance team, who already has to try to balance 154 champions, a harder job. 


Also the vast majority of the time, introducing some new build path with random new ratios one way or the other doesn't introduce diversity, it either creates a new 4fun build that almost never gets used or creates a new primary build for a champion, alienating their playerbase by changing their identity while simply making the previous build inferior, so you don't get a 50/50 AP/AD build split, players pick the most broken one.

I fail to think of a champion that has AP and AD ratios that is equally viable with either. The closest thing I can think of is Twitch, and he gets plays AP much more often.

AD shyvana? Almost never see it.
AP Rengar? Almost never see it unless I'm watching someone like Dekar play gold plat games on stream
AD Xin? Almost never saw it, now I'll probably never see it.
There's plenty of other examples, but it's just silly. 


TL;DR We don't need to try to split champions ratios down the middle to make them able to build every item in the game because :

A) One build always ends up being preferred/stronger, overshadowing the other
B) There's already 154 champions and counting to maintain balance for, there's multiple choices for any niche a player may want to fill (AD assassin, AP assassin etc.)",leagueoflegends

Yea there is +- 3 mages with 1% pickrate who can exist there, but they combined have 10x times less playrate than single Kai'sa. Mages are good champs for existing on botlane, but why riot nerfs them every time they showing up and having really playrate?(For example in last season when Cass lose her base armor to push her away from bot), lots of mages RN have problem with doupeel and can feel themself pretty good on bot, but they need last ""push"" from riot to get there.

I understand playing hook tank supports might be easier to climb with but it still does not solve what I am doing wrong . There are of course a lot of things I don’t know and i am wondering if a challenger told me the things I am doing wrong then would it significantly help my climb? If anyone has please tell me your experience! I will be thankful! 
I have also read a lot of guides on my champions and I watch vods too but I believe the best way to climb is to play the game. However, I want to know how far a coaching can get me ?",leagueoflegends

t3_m7sr46,Why was cutlass removed from bork? Didnt the build path just get way weaker for no reason?,"Feels like some items on new season have good build path and others have terrible build paths for no reason? like riot just pulled lottery to decide which are good and which are bad.

for example new bork build path compared to old is way worse, mainyl because of the removal of cutlass.

new triforce build path is way worse than old one, phage was a super good item that gave a good balance of hp/damage/movespeed. Now you have kindlegem that is 800 gold for 10 haste(useless) and 200 hp?
and hearthbound axe which gives way too much attack speed for any bruiser on early game.

Pretty obvious, his poison path is always available behind him, making it a death sentence to chase 

2) Teemo

Traps. He will always walk to his traps and you’ll die slowly and painfully. Not chase unless you have scanner 

3) Shaco

Same as Teemo, but he will also have a “friend” that helps him confuse your path. If he is AP, don’t chase him. And if he is pinkward, not even think about it

4) Taliyah

Everyone subestimates the damage of a full Q of Taliyah. If you chase her, she will kite you back as she is singed. Don’t do it

5) Kalista 

Same as Taliyah, their kits revolves in kiting. Unless your champ has some sort of PaC cc, don’t chase her because you’ll never reach her and she will stack enough spears to drill your butt 

6) Bard

Do. Not. Enter. Into. The. Portal. He will stun you to the wall and he has enough damage to kill you with some cheems",leagueoflegends

I even clashed with them and we won. I played my part. Still gotta lot to learn tho.

The thing is: every single game I lose in Solo Queue, I lose because one lane (mostly mid against something like katarina) just constantly dies to the point where you can't stop the enemy snwoball. In some cases I even gank a lane at the beginning, get them a 2/0/0 lead and they throw anyway. It happens like every other game and I just don't have the motivation to play anymore.

t3_m7rwr3,Need help building/understanding item viability,"Hi there, 

I’m basically a brand new player when it comes to league. I’ve played a handful of games being my friends support in bottom lane. But he was just telling me my build path and not really explaining why I was building certain items. But I wanna be able to play this game on my own time and hopefully not rely on him so much. But my biggest struggle with this game is item building. I have a ton of experience with mobas from Smite. And building in that game at this point is just second nature to me. But the item shop in LoL just seems so daunting to me. 

I want to play top lane since that’s closest to my main role of Solo in Smite. In smite I tend to player hyper aggressive tanks that just want to pressure the opponent all laning phase then just disrupt the back line in late game team fights. I’ve only played 2-3 games of top lane and proceeded to unintentionally feed/get farmed and got lots of backlash/hate from the other players. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",leagueoflegends
t3_m84j7v,Why are champions like Yone allowed to exist when compared to ADC,"Yone has literally everything you could ever need to carry a game. Massive damage, multiple forms of CC, all forms of damage, no mana, high scaling, 4 really strong abilities, sustain, shields, double crit chance and gap closers.

What can an ADC do that even somewhat compares to that? Lets take Samira for example. She has good damage, one gap closer on a kill reset only, .75 second W that only blocks projectiles, and her R on a static 8 second cooldown that can be cancelled by any form of CC other than a root. She has no shields, doesn't scale all that well, has mana, only has 1 gap closer that only resets on a kill, has no CC other than off of teammates, and only does physical damage.

ADC is literally short for ""Attack Damage CARRY"" and Samira is supposed to be the ""hyper carry adc"" on top of that. This is coming from someone who plays Yone as well and has experienced this disparity on both sides. If a Yone has 20 kills in a game, the game is pretty much doomed for the enemy team. If Samira has 20 kills, all you need is 1 cc move and she loses because 3/4 of her dmg is from her R. TF, Alistar, Bard, Annie, any of these champions with either super easy skillshots or straight point and click cc just insta kill Samira no matter how fed she is. While someone like Yone, ults into the entire enemy team, does all 3 forms of damage, has 3/4 of his damage on auto attacks and Q which has CC as well, and then E's out and does all that damage for free while sustaining and taking 35% reduced damage when he gets DD.

I love Yone's design don't get me wrong, he's a great champ in the game. But he and many other champions carry WAY easier than the carry role is supposed to. ADC was designed literally to just do the big damage on the team while being peeled for by the rest of the team. When you make a champion that has their own self peel, does more damage than the ADC, scales better than the ADC, benefits from ADC items BETTER than the ADC, and is EASIER to play, why would I even bother playing ADC? What is the entire point of the role at that point?",leagueoflegends

t3_m7dwtt,Who are some of the most oppressive lane matchups in the history of the game?,"Just a shower thought I had; which champions have been some of the least fun, oppressive to lame against in the game’s history?

Tank Ekko comes to mind as well, old solo lane soraka in like season 4, there are just so many that I couldn’t possibly remember them all, so let’s hear some of your thoughts!

Personally, I liked to play viktor top before It became a meta pick for a short time, and the first time I had to deal with it I felt like sadist for putting so many people through that.

t3_m81b68,Am i supposed to get worst teammates the the higher i climb?,"as a top laner who currently has around a 70-80 percent wr in g3, there are multiple games where my teammates have a wr way under mine. i believe matchmaking balances teams to around a 50 percent wr, so if you have a 70 percent wr, you might get a teammate with a 30 percent. although, i realize that wr doesn’t matter too often since if you play well, you can affect your teammates. However, when playing top lane i find many games where my teammates completely int on the other side of the map and there’s nothing i can do. me winning lane doesn’t mean anything, if 4 people on the enemy team win their laning phases. so i’m wondering if it’s even possible to consistently climb by playing top lane in low elo. i feel like in higher ranks, no one really completely loses their lane that hard, and games are more decided on team fights rather than which ever team got more fed in the laning phase in the early game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7830r,One thing I wish League would implement is the option to view champion guides with item sets and ability descriptions.,"I've been playing League for over a year now and recently started playing Dota 2, and one method Dota 2 has of catering to newer players (or players trying new Heroes) is that the game gives you the option to download guides made and verified by pro players. The guides can be imported at the start of the game and gives you a custom item set, ability skill order, and ability descriptions. 

https://preview.redd.it/y3bcpgol0nn61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b82f02dcffd253fe9ee9eda1d25b1bfc26695b13

This is much more accessible and even more viable at times than third-party apps from League because the guides visibly highlight what abilities need to be leveled (without needing to tab in and out of third-party apps to confirm skill order) AND they provide you with proper skill descriptions. 

With the new shop update, I think this would be an incredible implementation that would help players on newer champions/ new to the game.",leagueoflegends
t3_m806a2,"Literally noone is playing AP Ezreal anymore, not even in fun modes","AP Ez has always been a rare sight in Normal 5v5s (let alone Ranked), due to his weak early and non-existent waveclear. However, he was a frequent guest in modes like URF or Dominion (RIP), as the increased gold income and reduced importance of minion scores helped him to reach his power spike quicker. 

His strengths were a *very* strong, but skillshot reliant AoE burst (before the rework) or a very strong singletarget burst plus tower damage (after the rework) in the late mid/lategame. 

But now, after a short period of seeing him with hybrid builds, it seems that I am the only person left playing him. Even in URF people refuse to build anything but AD on him (I think I saw *one* AP Ez in the last ~~AR~~URF rotation).

So, what happened? I believe that the rework (despite Riot preserving his AP ratios) contributed a good part to this development, since the AoE damage of mage Ezreal was what made him different from his AD brother, but it can't be the only explanation. His instant single target burst from his W+E-combo is still way stronger with AP than AD.

Using my G733 K/DA LIGHTSPEED WIRELESS RGB GAMING HEADSET, I can now appreciate the blood-boiling bass of the “Match Found” sound. It reverberates throughout my whole system. Itching, I begin my performance. “mid pref”, I type, with my PRO K/DA MECHANICAL GAMING KEYBOARD. As I hover Seraphine, my presence immediately becomes known. I feel the ambition in my climb.

t3_m7zpzz,Riot's Design Philosophy on the New Generation of Champions and their attitude towards Monster Champions is a cause for concern.,"Besides they are all human (Yes Lillia isn't a human but neither the creature we are missing for long time from the game) and they feel so generic, so one diemnsional like they are targeted for a specific group, not to mention one of the last 8 champions was not designed for the game to make it better just for an event.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a statement from Riot Reav3:  
\**“VGUs totally count when we look at our year roadmap. We still want to make monsters and creatures we just make less of them since they are more niche and when we look at the years roadmap we include VGUs. That being said we have made it a goal to have at least one non-human new champ a year, and we might do more then 1 in a year where we didnt also do VGUs on monster champs. Yuumi was the non-human for 2019 and Lillia is the non-human for 2020. For 2020 though we already knew we were going to ship both Volibear and Fiddle so there wasnt that much room for more monster/creature champs, though we still made Lillia. One of the reasons we chose to make Lillia a whimsical/cute creature was to contrast Voli and Fiddle since we were doing 3 creatures/monster champs in a row. If Shyvana had won the VGU poll, for example, we might have done a new monster champ this year. TL:DR we still want to make creature/monster champs but less since they are niche, and VGUs count towards the amount we make”*

Riot is saying creatures are generally more niche than humans, so they’ll make 1 in a year (2 perhaps if there is no more vgu). - This is straight up lie from their part. They decide them to be nieche. They could give them a kit like any human champion has but they refuse it.

Do you know how many Skirmisher champions there are in League ? (The class that includes Yasuo, Jax and Fiora)? And how many of them are creatures? The answer is 12, and only 2 of them is a creature: Lillia and Kled. Lillia is arguably the most niche in terms of gameplay design of all of them.

Check assassin champions. Out of all assassin (16) champions only 3 are creatures: Fizz, Rengar and Kha’Zix. 4 if we count Nocturne.  
ADC champions ? 24 champions, 5 creatures: Tristana, Kog’Maw, Kindred, Corki and Twitch  
Tanks: 14 Vanguards (9), 6 wardens(3). This side is much better in terms of state than the rest.

What this means. Well we can talk about it after we analyze the more successful creatures since , yes, Riot has created successful, popular creature champions multiple times. And they seemingly just don’t care to factor in to their data for some reason ? Warwick, Malphite, Yuumi, Volibear and Thresh are all prime examples of creatures that endure as popular champions throughout League’s history, and there are other standouts such as Rengar, Hecarim, Kha’Zix.

Feels like Kindred and Aurelion Sol had something to do with this; like how they as champions received huge positive reception for their themes, characterization and the like, but then more or less flopped in the popularity department, and Riot took it hard enough they don’t believe a non-human can be successful regardless of what they do. But this 2 champions right now truly has either very niche style of gameplay or gutted into weakness.

&amp;#x200B;

Bard. One of the most unique and fun support to this day with a kit that allows huge plays.

Tahm Kench: Extremly good tank support or so he used to be because he was continously gutted for having huge presence in esport. He was supposed to get rework last year, he might get it this year.

Kindred: Another extremly fun champion who seen it's own due of nerfs-buffs and minor changes since their kit was allowed such ""niche"" palys that requied changes.

Aurelion Sol: The most fun out all mages. Many player says they want to play him, pick him up but Riot reworked him then nerfed to oblivion so he has no damage early game at all, can't 1v1 in most cases and needs extremly more input, higher level of skills now to play efficiently than what most champions require while existing in an extremly weak state. His win rate is around 52-53% thanks to dedicated mains but statisticly only 0,8-1,1% of the playerbase picks him so compared to that this winrate is actually low. Katarina has around 10% pickrate with 51%-ish winrate just to see compraison.

Kled: Fun top laner who ,along with Bard, is in much better shape than most but Yordle champions are unique among creatures for most them are more playable than other creatures.

Ivern: Another niche jungler who is fun to play but only played by like 2% of playerbase.

Bonus Is Illaoi the only female champion among humans who is the opposite of generic design.

And here is a list of nonhuman races: Ascended, Animals, Darkin, Celestials, Demons, Robots, Undeads, Spirits, Yordles, Voidborns. DRAGONS!?

What I'm trying to say is most creatures designed TO BE niche champion and Riot uses this term as an excuse why they develop less of them. They could design them not to be niche champion. They have a few from that department. It's just looks like they sold creativity of creatures for the simpler and more boring design of humans. Runeterra is a mysterious and vast world with characters that come in many forms and different backgrounds and that's what I like so much about this universe.

When did you dear reader was last excited for a champion reveal ? And if you truly are for every one of them how you felt when they revealed their last creature(s) ? For me it was way more exciting like you. And, no, I do not count Lillia and Yuumi as creatures, not the type what we are all talking about because their cuteness just matches the new ideals which by Riot designs their new releases.

3. Feeling useless until x items: obviously this isnt an adc problem only but tbf all adcs have this problem, you cant 1v1 unless its a pretty specific situation, you cant sidelane because you'll get dove, if you play extra safe you lose farm and scale slower etc.
4. Soloq is nonoq: never I repeat NEVER soloq as an adc as your too team and time reliant to be effective, so duo with either a decent sup or someone who can carry the earlygame and can let you scale into the late.

As a closing thought I wanted to say that I've been grinding my ass off, whatced replayes, tried to learn from streamers, and I just can't climb, I have good cs, I have good dmg, I have few deaths but my win rate is still 50% so if someone could tell me something because im actually going mad from this.

PS: I know most of what I'm saying is either incorrect or phrased incorrectly, but I just want to improve so pls if you have any advice tell me, I just want to get better at this game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7o76a,Something Retro for Aatrox,"Hey there everyone!  


Im an Aatrox One Trick from EUNE and I was thinking about creating this post here for some time now. Before you start reading, no this isn't going to be a revert Aatrox post, but more like adding a little ""retro"" stuff for him. As we all know it's been nearly 3 years since Aatrox got Reworked, and a lot have happened since that time. A lot of people started liking and maining him, while in the meantime a lot of the old mains have stopped playing the champion because it got changed way too much both in kit and personality. This is a very old topic yeah I know, but it keeps returning after a while and there is something that I don't really understand about it. Not too long ago in an ASK RIOT post ([https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-lessons-from-dev/](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-lessons-from-dev/)) u/Reav3 talked a bit about Aatrox, but there is the part about the alienation that we heared a lot of times in the past, and it leaves me with one question: If Riot is truly sorry for alienating a lot of the old mains, then why we never really got any sort of compensation in the past? Im not talking about bringing back the old Aatrox as a new champ, but more like creating something like a Traditional Skin for him. This is what my post is really about. As someone who played the old Aatrox a lot and still playing/Maining him after the Rework, I would personally like to play him with a ""Retro"" skin that would have his old voice lines and features like his old horns. wings and sword too just like on this picture: [https://preview.redd.it/0hm80g7lt0661.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0be95babfdc517f6befdaac845d42e06c60f0fa](https://preview.redd.it/0hm80g7lt0661.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0be95babfdc517f6befdaac845d42e06c60f0fa) (The picture is not made by me). I think this would look awesome on him, as well as it would also bring back a little of his old form while remaining the same in kit to the current one. Furthermore it would also be a nice little compensation for the alienated old mains even after all these years since his rework came out. So what do you guys think? Would it be cool to have a Traditional Aatrox skin and play him with a little retro style?

Many players have a really small threshold after which they stop tolerating being behind and just want to exit the game by surrendering.

However, many games are often winnable.

As patchs come your mental model about ""lost matchs"" can become obsolete.

If your mates want to continue and think it is winnable: Try to believe them instead of doubling down on your own believes. You may learn that your tolerance threshold for falling behind is off.

I believe it is good practice to once in a while recheck your tolerance level against others (or any odds) to raise your own bar and also to update your mental model about what's actually lost at what point and what is not.

t3_m6lf53,"Niles has the second most deaths (87), the fewest kills (15) and the worst KDA (1.1) of any non-support player in LCS history to play a full split","I obtained all my data from Oracle's elixir, and only included 18 game splits for consistency. I did include tiebreaker games in these numbers but removing them wouldn't have effected final standings at all. Support players were counted to be eligible for the most deaths ""award"" but not for fewest kills, after all you reach a point where a support having too many kills could be considered a bad thing. There has never been in a non-support player with the fewest kills. In most splits, the top or jungle player with the fewest kills still has more kills than nearly all supports that split.

Some interesting factoids from this

* Svenskeren and Niles share as the only players to have the fewest kills and most deaths in the same split. 
* Flaresz who holds the record with 90 deaths is the only player even in the ballpark of of Niles, with no other players passing 75 deaths in 18 games. 
* There are quite a lot of players with very good splits in the fewest kill category, Xmithie even has some All-Pro splits included. 
* Contracz and Xmithie with multiple appearances on the list. 
* Niles is the only non-support to average under 1 kill per game.

I don't think Niles is the worst player to ever play in the LCS. There are multiple other players with worst stats under a smaller sample size. What makes Niles so unique is that he was never benched and also never really improved either. You will quite often see players with very few kills start to play more aggressive near the end of the split, or vice versa for few deaths. Niles didn't really change much. I don't think bringing in Solo or another top laner would have saved GGS's split or Niles's career, but they certainly could have saved his dignity.

I loose my lane almost every game no matter how safe i play or aggressive i play. I learned all the champions and the only problem i seem to be having is how much more better they are at trading.

Once they win a trade its usually an all in or they can freeze the wave and i loose xp or risk my life getting ganked by their jg. Sometimes i can track their jg but then if i try to poke out the laner can gapclose and kill me.

So im forced to sit under my turret and hopefully farm myself but they poke hard or shove hard so i loose xp and gold either way. At this point im useless and i spend the rest of the game depressed as everyone else can play while i attempt to farm and go back into hiding.

I keep getting carried though by people like darius or vayne or some really good mid laner whos pretty much a god imo. Now im getting into games and i can barely touch farm without getting poked or dived. The teams are also much more coordinated.

Is there any way to go back to my actual skill level? I freeze up when things get to quick and its hard to think at all. Part of the reason i suck at trades but i know how to ward really well and time camps incase my jungle is ganking and its free gold to help me.

**It is Alphari, by a long shot. The man absolutely massacred everyone in every matchup. TL also looking very strong going into playoffs**

**-------**

**Background:** We see a lot of rankings based on differentials, but those have always bothered me a lot of the time. Players are playing losing champion matchups and then being attacked later (after people forget the matchups) for having a low CS differential or gold differential for the year. So I wanted to make a matchup-proof ranking.

To further elaborate, what this ranking is doing is looking at how, for example, a pro played Leblanc into Zoe and comparing against how every other mid or top laner pro player played that matchup. So if you score really high, that could mean every game this season you were down in CS, but what it would also mean, is that when other pros played that EXACT same matchup, they were even more down in CS. So if Chovy was down 15 cs in a matchup, that probably means on average, other pros were down somewhere between 20-30 cs in that same matchup, as an example, as Chovy has a good score.

So what is v3. v1 and v2 did a good job of accounting for laning statistics, those are obviously still included. But I have now focused on adding three more statistics/things: roaming/towers and game effectiveness. (1) Roaming/Towers looks at how often you were involved with first bloods outside of your lane and also your gold income outside of CS. If you roam and get a kill, what did it cost? I think people tend to forget about turret plates in pro play. And (2) game effectiveness, this looks at how much damage you are doing over the amount of gold you are getting as well as your ability to translate that into wins. (Please keep in mind these stats are also normalized against champion matchups) And (3) JUNGLERS NOW INCLUDED. (Also, I can do bot lanes, but it is a lot more work because of how champs work down there and I have not gotten to creating the code for that yet, sorry.)

**Lux:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371877332672155652)

*Far out in the cosmos, the people deee-lite I'm the rule of the fabulous Space Princess Luxandra IV. She's on a mission to guard the electrifying force known as The Funk from Dr. Crankenstein and his Cool Cats. On the way, she's gonna show the whole cosmos that groove is in the heart.*

**Samira:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371877655826505733)

*Space Princess Luxandra doesn’t suspect that her groovy bodyguard Samira ""Foxy"" Indari is actually a double agent for the Cool Cats. But, on the other paw, Dr. Crankenstein is equally unaware that the bop-gun wielding merc might actually be a triple agent instead.*

**Blitzcrank:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371877997360291841)

*Dr. Crankenstein commands his Cool Cat legion to finally get his paws on The Funk. His exuberant sidekick Blitz follows him into battle with a cry of ""The name is blitzy, baby!"" Together they will make the princess give up The Funk. Gotta have that Funk.*

**Nunu &amp; Willump:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371876568683802625)

*Space Cadet Nunu lived a quiet life until he was swept up with The Funk-infused discobeast Willump. Now they go on out-of-this world adventures all over the cosmos. He just has to get Willump to stop running down Mid Lane with a red trinket…*

**Nasus:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371876726079324161)

*Lord of the Atomic Dogs, Nasus has succeeded his mentor, Disco Duck, to become defender of The Funk. Now, he works with Space Princess Luxandra to go all bow wow wow yippe yo yippe yeah on the totally unrighteous goolies working for Dr. Crankenstein. Good boy!*

**Lulu:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371878312306376705)

*When that strange Funk-Powered alien Lulu beams herself to a new planet they call her Le Freak. But with a wave of her disco wand, she turns the entire planet into a funky town. Then this space dandy is off on her next interstellar adventure. In her own strange little head she has one goal, to unite all nations under a groove.*

**Rumble:** [Splash Art](https://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1371877127188967427)

*The Cool Cats span the cosmos as the grappling arm of Dr. Crankenstein in the search for The Funk. Their former second-in-command, Rumble encountered the mysterious power source, and he’s been movin’ and groovin’ ever since. Now this fantastic feline is on a new mission. To spread the boogie to his former cat comrades.*",leagueoflegends
t3_m80jph,"So glad i quit, Most toxic game EVER.","I honestly dont know how people continue to play League of Legends. Its has the most toxic and childish players i have ever seen. Its always someone flamming, afking, raging, tilted, purposely doing actions to make the team lose such as taking cs or refusing to help etc. Had my 1st game after months and i quit because of the toxicity and the afking rage quitters. Came back to try a game and i was just proven even right why this game isnt for me. I still dont understand why people play this game seriously (ranked). I only see this game being fun with friends where everyone just has fun and enjoys the game. All those years ive spent playing ranked and tilting off flammers and afkers, i wish i could get those years back lol. How else do you guys deal with the horrible people playing this game? Ye you can mute all but that ruins communications and even if you dont type you could still tilt someone because your laner TP gank or ganked after you pinged missing, they just rage and tilt off that. Majority of the people playing this game are so toxic, ive played many games and i can tell you League is the most toxic. I highly don't suggest playing this game seriously, play it for fun with friends because there are some kids online that you will want to punch in the face because of how childish and unhuman like they act, ive seen people wish cancer on others and family members wished upon to die, its absurd. Of course in real life these kids wont talk shit or say things like that because of the consequences, but online they have the screen as a shield lol. I loved this game but most of the people are just here to ruin the gaming experience.",leagueoflegends
t3_m7lvax,Any use for left over prestige points?,"Hello.

Recently I was made aware that the 2020 prestige points are to be removed from inventory by May 2021. However I am not sure if there is any means to spend them prior if you lack 100 even to outright purchase a skin. Is anyone aware of any other options that are available or will be made available to do with leftovers?",leagueoflegends
t3_m793ry,When do I get out from smurf queue?,"I recently started ranked again, after several chill seasons and I only get matched up with lvl 30-40 accounts who are totally random in skill level. Also they absolutely don't care about the game or if they account get banned, as in this lobby they say "" 2 dollar on ebay dude"".

When do I get out of this? I placed in Gold IV, but I didn't get a single lvl 50+ normal account.

t3_m7dadn,"What is, in your opinion, the single most powerful ability in the game with appropriate counterplay?","Very hard to say for me personally, but i would probably say Olaf Q just because it is the way for Olaf to run you down, but it can be dodged and Olaf then can't really reach you... If he doesn't have Stridebreaker

Elise Stun would probably also be here",leagueoflegends
t3_m77cs8,The champions of season 11,"So we know that the order is:

01. Isolde
02. The Yordle
03. The Nontraditional Marksman
04. ?
05. ?

As we know, they will be 1 for each role and 1 bonus for the midlane because there are 2 types: melee assassin and mage.

JG is already taken by Viego;
Isolde is Top;
The Yordle is the midlane mage.

There are left the support champion, the adc and the melee assassin. What do you think about the Nontraditional Marksman:

- It will be the support just like Senna? (Also, it's a member of Sentinels of Lights too so it would make sense I guess).

- It will replace the ""melee"" assassin (I don't think so) from the midlane by the fact that it's a nontraditional carry so it will be played on a nontraditional position?

- It will be the actual adc? (Again: I don't think so)

- It will be a BONUS champion so we will have 7 total champions: Top (Isolde), JG (Viego), Mid Mage (Yordle), Mid Melee AD (?), ADC (?), Support (?) and the Nontraditional Marksman.

Let me know what do you think guys, I'm pretty curious, thx",leagueoflegends

it would be super unique gameplay, and the 0/10 powerspike meme could be a real thing.  the benefits would be you would have to figure out how to maybe CC and peel or do some other aspect and balance out not killing the enemy or making sure your teammate gets the kill.  

On top of that, you would have to balance out how much gold you give the enemy to get to a certain level of usefulness.

maybe it could be a total support or something.

Assuming they can communicate well enough with the team, they would never need wards, and no one on their team should ever die to ganks. Is that enough to offset the gigantic mechanical mismatch on an individual level? 

Also, another thought, but how would Riot react to someone like that? Banned from pro play even though they aren't 'technically' breaking any rules? Obviously it'd be an unfair advantage, but I'm not quite sure how you'd prove it, since they aren't actually modifying files.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know a lot of you are not stupid, but I need to state for the people who actually do not know better: I am talking to you 'Gold Elo' and lower, yes being in 'Gold Elo' means absolutely nothing.

\[Magic Damage\] will always use the \[Magic Resistance\] stat.

\[Physical Damage\] will always use the \[Defense\] stats.

No matter the 'Stat Ratio'-Stat Ratio

A. AD% = Total Attack Damage%  
B. bonus AD% = Total Damage - base Attack Damage  
C. **base** AD% = base Attack Damage without any items included.  
D. AP% = Total Ability Power (There is no base Ability Power...yet)  
E. Armor = Total Armor  
F. **bonus** Armor = Total Armor - **base** Armor  
G. **bonus** Magic Resist = Total Magic Resist - **base** Magic Resistance  


Note: There is not a single Ability or Item in the game that use \[**base** Armor\] or \[**base** Magic Resistance\] by themselves, in the whole game - Most of you are using 'Lethality' on a Champion that uses primarily \[Magic Damage\], knowing full well that the same exact Champion's \[Basic Attack\] does nothing.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Epilogue:

I will not lie to you, I know I do not think about the game like the rest of you and that I do not play the game like the rest of you: I am the Type of person who actually uses every single stat on every Champion, and this includes 'Attack Damage' with 'Ability Power' 'Kai'Sa'.

I understand that 'Lethality' looks fun and cool, but you have to rely on one ability to do damage: However when you use 'Attack Damage' and 'Ability Power', you can literally use all your abilities which would all do more than you 'Lethality' \[Mystic Shot\].

I did not even add \[Nashor's Tooth\]  
[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Nashor's\_Tooth](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Nashor's_Tooth)  
to these calculations, which would add base damage and another 20% AP to \[Mystic Shot\].

I did not even add \[Muramana\]  
[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Muramana](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Muramana)  
to these calculation, which would add base damage and then additional damage based on Max Mana.

Ezreal is actually fucking Disgusting: Remember that only one item made these ratios like this, You literally have five other item slots - all of which I use for Magic Penetration leaving me two slots, which I use for 'Muramana' and 'Rabadon's Deathcap' because it is actually fucking disgusting do the fact that 'Ability Power' Ratios already go over 100%: \[Rabadon's Deathcap\] simply multiplies that numerical that is mathematical over '1' by \[Rabadon's Deathcap (1.35) and that 'multiplicative' and in simple terms ""is very fast"": As a result I deal over 1,500 damage literally unless they have max resist which will result in me deal about 10% Maximum Health in the case of 'Cho'Gath' or 'Sion', of course this is at ""Full Build"", however let's be honest that the over all ratio's of damage dealt to the target's \[Maximum Health\] does not change much.

Ending Comments: The shit is actually disgusting, all you need to do actually survive long enough and it is game over and that only requires skill.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7wsfb,I might have just played the most boring game of League of Legends ever,"&amp;#x200B;

So basically I'm smurfing and trying to climb to my other account's rank, as I heard EUW players are better- that's why I'm in silver 3 in this game. anyway.

I had a jungler that won't gank but still finds a way to go 3/9

an adc that gives a free kill to your laner

a 1/7 morgana support flaming me

a feeding toplaner 

and me, 1/0/0 orianna stuck farming under turret because I can't outpush a lucian in the early game, down only 20 cs mind you pinging assist me every once in awhile, knowing full well this lucian is always pushed up and a free kill if anyone comes to help me. 

my jungler proceeds to: start drake while Lucian has mid prio and feed him a free kill. I never got a chance to do anything because I was stuck in lane hoping my team grows a brain. the miss fortune might look like they aren't inting but they gave a 200 gold shutdown to the lucian at lvl 6 after I backed. they just... level 4 miss fortune vs level 6 lucian what could go wrong? someone would probably say get good, but I could probably be an LEC player and still couldn't find a way to win this game because of the nature of mine and my opponent's champions... Orianna can go even with Lucian but cannot win, as I can poke thanks to my q's superior range, slowly poking him down and forcing him to base, the thing is that after he gets vamp scepter poking him down doesn't work anymore and I have to sit back and try to scale while not being able to push the wave out. the annoying thing about this game is that I didn't make a single mistake in lane, I nearly solokilled lucian and forced his teleport, after which he came back with a vamp scepter, tanked my poke and kept shoving the wave while trying to do something to me I'm not quite sure what... 

These kinds of match-ups aren't common but do exist in the game and I feel like Riot desperately needs to remove them, a player having no impact on a game because of the champion they picked instead of the way they played is a surefire way to lose your playerbase slowly, what's worse than losing? losing while knowing you didn't make a single mistake in the entire game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7s4qw,Is inting only tower related?,"How is inting detected? 

I mean is it only banned when people run into the enemy turret and get killed by it?

I know it's not the best sport, but if a match is pathetically gone I soft int by going into the guy they fed 12/1 and he kills me in 1 sec, is it bannable?

I mean, I still finish the match with half of the deaths of the feeders by doing this, the reason I do is because it's the only way to make those match finish or a surrender vote to pass, but I don't know what inting is for Riot.

Are there any way to distinguish soft int from playing bad? Apart from dying to/under turrets

I see so many people playing so bad that it should be considered inting, if you do the same mistake 10 times in 10 minutes, yet their account is alive and kicking so I don't think there is a punishment",leagueoflegends

t3_m72gs3,I would love an app like Path of building for League,"I was thinking the other day, wouldn't it be great to have an app similar to Path of building used in Path of Exile, for league of legends.

I mean you could pick a champ, runes, and then mess about with items builds to see what works vs another champ you can 'build' with the app.

Now I know you can do this (sort of) in the training tool, but that takes ages to load in each time you make a change to runes etc.
I want to see what a theoretical MF build would do to a level 13 Darius with a chosen set of items, Which you cant do in Training mode, you can't pick what the enemy bot builds and you can force them to level up and go non-hostile etc.

If we had a similar app like PoB that updates with League so damage numbers are current, I think this would be great to create builds quickly and know straight away if they work without, trolling teammates in a normal with a 'new build' that may look odd.",leagueoflegends

I can get solokill on him lvl 2, or even 2kills before lvl6. Then once he gets lvl6, if he hits an R, it's 100% death. Even if he misses, his QWE also easily takes 70% of my HP. And this is when he is behind. 

If he is slightly ahead, QE is a one shot.

If he is a bit fed, Q is a death (of course with W passive).

Like there is no way I can think of to beat this champion. But I know he isn't popular in proplay, so there should be some way to beat Fizz. However I am only interested in 1v1 scenarios, not ""calling jgl to roam"" ""team play"" etc, because that is not something you can count on in soloq.

t3_m7uzgo,Bruisers &amp; Mages is the embodiment of what drives assassins off from mid lane,"Renekton &amp; Lissandra perfectly encapsulates the current game play philosophy of Riot: Renekton is manaless, has sustain (or has access to it through runes / items), his kit fixes his supposed problems (he is a melee champ and yet he gets huge range on his spammable Q, harassing the mid lane assassins due to his bruiser playstyle. Lissandra utilities mana, but has the ability to lock down champs with her R and W. With the broken Everfrost build, you can CC someone for 4-5 seconds which completely breaks the game. In addition to that, with her R and Zhonyas, it's impossible to do any damage to her without wasting all your abilities. 

Add all these stuff up and you get champs that bully out the mid assassins with their strong wave clear, and CC abilities plus stasis. And there is no way to all - in them without using all your abilities, but you lack the damage to finish the kill essentially eliminating the usefulness of assassins in the game. They just do too many things and too many abilities that hard counter or stat checks out the assassins in the mid lane, while both scale really really well.",leagueoflegends
