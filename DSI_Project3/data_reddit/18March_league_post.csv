t3_m7t72z,Viego is the embodiment of what drives mages off from mid lane,"Viego perfectly encapsulates the current gameplay philosophy of Riot: he is manaless, has sustain (or has access to it through runes/items), his kit fixes his supposed problems (he should be a melee champ, yet he has 650 range spammable Q, getting harassed in lane due to his melee nature is fixed by his inbuult sustain).

 Add all these stuff up and you get a mana-less, sustained early game bully, who can endlessly shove wave after wave, forcing the mage to spend their mana, or just force trades to burn their mana even faster because he can just heal it back. And even if the mage survives all this until Chapter/Tear, Viego can just 100 to 0 them after 6, especially now that Seekers is garbage.
 Aaaaaand then Viego can choose to either be a splitpush menace or snowball a teamfights through his invulnerability and grasshopper execute ult. 
He just does too many things, while he can just straight up stat check or choke out mages from mid, while also scaling really really well.

Edit: Terrorising mid lane, even tho he was designed as a jungler... really good job :)",leagueoflegends

t3_m7udjh,New champion idea: John,"Every new champion release, we get a bit more disappointed. We got Viego, the ruined simp, Sera-whatever, Rell?(Who was this again?).

We need someone more interesting, someone more unique, someone with a lovable attitude.

&amp;#x200B;

So hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

We need John, the Business Major

&amp;#x200B;

Lore: John is a business major from Piltover. He currently works as a secretary and accountant for the Targonian aspects after getting abducted by Zoe because she had been charged with tax evasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Release skin: Battlecast John

John is Viktor's second in command. He manages the building of the battlecast army. He has some doubts about Viktor's ideals, but at least he still has a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Passive: Hi I'm John

Friendly guy in the workplace, you don't know why, but you can't help but like him. John takes 20% less damage from all sources.

At the beginning of the game, John will get able to invest in stocks. Stocks 1 would be health, 2 would be mana, 3 would be gold. He can only hold a certain stock at a time, and he must sell his stocks in order to get different ones. 

Killing or participating in a kill would increase the value of your stocks while dying will decrease the value of your stocks. 

(John doesn't have to invest in stocks at the start. There is no time limit on your stocks, but if your stocks go negative, you will get negative stats. Less health/mana/gold debt respectively. These stocks can stack infinitely positive, but only a certain amount negative.)

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Funny guy

CD: 15/14/13/12/11

John makes a clever remark, channeling for 3.5 seconds. If John completes the channel, any unit within earshot (excluding neutral monsters) will be charmed for 2 seconds. Any champion hit will decrease the ability by 1 second.

(Channel time decreases with levels)

(Range increases with levels)

&amp;#x200B;

W: Clumsy guy 

CD: 8 at all levels

John accidentally spills some coffee on the floor, applying a root for 0.25 seconds, slowing for 50%, and deals 25 true damage on splash and 5 true damage per second every second they are in the spill. The spill lasts for 5 seconds.

(Spill duration increases with levels)

(Damage increases by levels)

&amp;#x200B;

E: Smiley guy 

CD: 40/35/30/25/20

John smiles his bright, white smile for 10 seconds, blinding and charming everyone in front of him. After 10 seconds, he shines even brighter, knocking champions into the air. If John affects a champion then it will decrease the ability by 50%. John's movespeed is 50% until he decides to stop.	

(Blinding and charm duration increases by level).

(This is similar to a Cassiopeia ult. Except it's constant.)

&amp;#x200B;

R: Inflation

CD: 240/180/120

Passive: At 6, every item's cost will be proportionally equal to one random country's inflation rate, decreasing the value of gold as the game goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

Active: John manipulates the market and makes every item on the enemy's shop 30% more expensive for 30 seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

t3_m7qbg6,I want a permanent pve game mode.,"I truly love this game, I like the characters, the skills, the theme of the game and absolutely love the mechanics.

I've been playing this game since season 2 and I'm finding hard lately to enjoy playing against other people. I don't find fun stomping other people or being stomped, watching persons play cheese or meta champs over and over. However I've had so much fun playing game modes like Odyssey or Doom Bots with friends. I liked so much the experimentation with the characters, things like Ziggs healer man.

I wouldn't mind if they just added the past events so that players could replay them even if they added no new content. Also it wouldn't cost them too much as the events have already been developed.

There would be much more to do as a player than rankeds, normals and arams...

EDIT: Tyvm for the comments, I knew nothing about the upcoming MMO, seems pretty interesting!  
2 EDIT: Guys, I would love to play that PvE game called Jungle but I don't think it would be too fair for my team.",leagueoflegends

t3_m876wt,How I imagine buying a skin should look like,"One of the main things you should see when buying a skin is the splash, instead of the exact same thumbnail (and a bit smaller too) and some text saying ""Pick up a new look for *X* !""

When browsing in the shop for skins, the steps you need to follow just to have a look at the splash are:

1. Click the thumbnail in the store.
2. Click ""Learn more"", it takes you to the champion profile.
3. Click on ""Skins""
4. Then search for the skin because the default position is the base skin

All of that to just see the splash of the skin you're buying, aaand if you're interested in the text that accompanies each skin, you won't see it this way, you have to go to Collection and then Skins for that text to show.

So I believe this way of showing the splash, which I don't think it's complicated at all, should improve the buying experience.

t3_m7okvq,"Is there a reason why Riot is buffing Sylas instead of fixing this highly annoying, 100% reproducable bug that negatively impacts his power level instead?","I'm talking about the one where he simply loses all his passive stacks whenever he uses R to steal an ult. It has been in the game for 4 or 5 patches already and happens every single game, every time I use R to steal an ult. The moment the chain with the stolen Ult comes back, all passive stacks are instantly gone.

To reproduce it, just go into practice mode and steal any ult with Sylas. As soon as the chain returns, you will immediately lose all passive stacks you had (including the one you got from casting R).

So worst case scenario is, you try to engage with e1 -&gt; r -&gt; e2 and are left with 0 stacks instead of the expected 3. 

And yes, I did post in the bug megathread already, but since Riot seems to be oblivious as to why Sylas WR is so low the last few patches and just randomly decided to buff him now, it seems they are STILL completely unaware of this bug",leagueoflegends

If you just want the emote because it's animated and cool you have to buy the full bundle which cost 2250RP, they're basically trying to replace the pass that is missing from this event and i think a **Pass** would give more value for less but i didn't calculate this so correct me if i'm wrong. The bundle is also available for a limited time so you can't buy it once the event ends. The bundle is only worth it if you were planning to buy 3 or more Battle Academia Capsules anyway but if you just want the emote or you already own all the skins then you're paying 1500-1800 RP for content that you don't need.",leagueoflegends

&gt;You guys gave me a 2nd half to my career. You made this fun for me again and I will forever be grateful for the time I was able to be your Coach. I love you guys.

His tweet makes it sound like there was some kind of falling-out with his last team, Golden Guardians Academy. They finished 9th in the NA Academy 2021 Spring Split and just yesterday, hours after his announcement, played and won the [Giant Slayer Gauntlet Final](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Giant_Slayer_Gauntlet/2021_Season/Spring) against [EG Academy](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/m7gwcu/eg_academy_vs_gg_academy_giant_slayer_gauntlet/). This comes only a week after the GGA assistant coach SeeEl [announced he was leaving the team](https://twitter.com/coachseeel/status/1369925271416016900).

He sounds a bit defeated and sad, so I hope he finds happiness in whatever he does next. I even remember meeting him at MSI 2018 in Berlin, but not even he could explain the [Sejuani support pick from Hylissang in the FNC vs KZ match](https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8jkcj6/fnatic_vs_kingzone_dragonx_msi_2018_group_stage/) to me.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7nuuw,So someone sent a detailed email on their Pantheon build to Rossboomsocks and detailed why its the 'mathematically correct' way to build Pantheon. I'm not good enough of a player to refute the information. Any good players care to give their opinion on it? Basically they say flat pen &gt; Percent pen,"""I have found, tested, and abused a build so OP that I am confident if you post a video on it and your viewers pick it up, it will result in a nerf. This is well beyond Senna crit guinsoo's broken and also has to do with haywire calculations. I've written a full explanation so you can get an understanding of this insanity.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Pantheon breaks lethality calculations and does beyond true damage to nearly all targets.

&amp;#x200B;

\----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, people build Pantheon all wrong. They go eclipse, cleaver, and other bruiser items as well as going concqueror because he can quickly stack it. To be clear, this is still a good build, but it actually has some major mathematical flaw relating to armor penetration order of operations.

&amp;#x200B;

The way armor pen is calculated in League is in four steps:

1. Flat Reductions
2. Percent Reductions
3. Percent Penetration
4. Flat Penetration

&amp;#x200B;

Flat changes stack additively and percent changes stack multiplicatively. What does that mean? It means that if you have two instances of reducing or penetrating through 100 armor by 10 and10, you have 100 - 10 - 10 = 80. However, if you have two instances of 10%, you have 100 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 81. What happens is that the percent changes decrease the effectiveness of the next percent instance. If I have Pantheon's 30% pen passive and Serylda's Grudge of 30% pen, the resulting pen is 49% instead of the expected 60%. If you also throw in an Eclipse, which should have 16% pen, you only get 41%. That's Awful!

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, people think since Pantheon has armor pen build in, you should lean into getting more. This is entirely wrong. Armor penetration % by being calculated before lethality, actually should be paired with the flat penetration of lethality. Whereas armor % pen reduces the efficiency of the next instance of their %, it INCREASES the effectiveness of flat pen by that amount. Actually, because armor is logarithmic, it increases the effectiveness of lethality exponentially.

&amp;#x200B;

To be exact, Pantheon's 30% innate armor penetration increases the effectiveness of Lethality by 42.8%

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get into the build....

&amp;#x200B;

1. Prowler's Claw
2. Essence Reaver
3. Boots
4. Lethality Item
5. Lethality Item
6. Blade of the Ruined King

&amp;#x200B;

This build with Sudden Impact will give you 30% armor penetration and 84 lethality (or 72 at the lowest). What this means is that you will do TRUE DAMAGE to anyone at or below 120 armor (103 at the lowest).

&amp;#x200B;

Prowler's Claw also comes with a badass trick. You can use it to climb the wave and then leap stun someone who doesn't expect it. Because of how overloaded with damage this build is, you do not need to use it on your target.

&amp;#x200B;

Essence Reaver is the best item on Pantheon in the game. It has everything he could want and sustains him. He casts his Q and W so often that it's procced like crazy, and he can take towers with ease because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The two lethality items you want to get are Youmoo's and Serpent's Fang, depending on Matchup. The Collector is also good and adds more crit chance, but it has less lethality and flat AD than Youmoo's. Pantheon has insane AD ratios, so getting these items are a big part of why this is better than regular bruiser Pantheon.

&amp;#x200B;

You've already tried BOtRK and you know its busted on him, it is what takes this from a build that one shots everyone and third healths tanks to one shotting the tanks as well. Keep in mind that you are doing true damage, so BOtRK does a true 10% Current health.

&amp;#x200B;

When this doesn't work:

&amp;#x200B;

You might think that this is a shit build if the enemy team has tanks. You would be terribly wrong. If you go the typical build of Eclipse and Cleaver on him, the beak even point of penetration between the standard and my wacky build occurs at 304 armor. That's right - you have to be a mega tank for the penetration to be equal! And suppose you don't build the cleaver. The breakeven point doesn't occur until 687.5 armor. No one builds 687.5 armor.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the mathematically correct way to build the champion.

&amp;#x200B;

Runes:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Press the Attack
2. Triumph
3. Alacrity (Tenacity if needed)
4. Coup de Grace (Cut Down if they have big bois)

&amp;#x200B;

5. Sudden Impact

6. Ravenous Hunter

&amp;#x200B;

You should go Press the Attack. It is absolutely the best rune. Conqueror is the wrong rune choice for anything but tank Pantheon. The empowered W procs PTA, it makes him incredibly dominant in lane, and it means that your damage with all the stuff mentioned above is multiplied even more. You do beyond true damage. You do 112% of the damage applied. Actually, I take that back; because your combo is Empowered W into Q, you likely get them to below 40% before it's done, and Coup de Grace is procced as well. That becomes 1.12 x 1.08 = 1.209% input damage.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. This is some seriously broken shit that I hope you have a blast trying out. Unlike other lethality builds that fall off late, this build actually scales. You can and will always one shot anyone who has less than 3-4 tank items.""",leagueoflegends

Quoting directly from them, if you don't really have time to read all of it:

Exhibit A

&gt;Shari reached out to me in Summer 2020 \[...\] she told me about her plan to file a lawsuit against Mr. Laurent \[...\] I told her that Mr. Laurent never did anything wrong to me \[...\] I told Shari that I had never seen anything inappropriate between Mr. Laurent and Shari.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;After Shari's lawsuit was filed, I received many calls, texts, and messages from journalists \[...\] I lost my job with another employer because of all the harassment that I received from journalists \[...\] I know that it must have been Shari that gave out my number to journalists \[...\] on February 16, 2021 Shari called me \[...\] She told me that she either gave my number to journalists or her attorney  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;I am concerned that Shari will misuse my personal information \[...\] I'm afraid for my personal identity and security since I know Shari gave out my number to the press.

Exhibit B

&gt;I understand that Shari recently filed a lawsuit against Mr. Laurent for sexual harassment. I haven't experienced anything like that while working for Mr. Laurent, and I've never seen or heard anything inappropriate between him and Shari. I think she made up the claims in her lawsuit.  
&gt;  
&gt;I began receiving strange and threatening calls on my cell phone at the end of February, 2021 \[...\] The first call \[...\] a woman said that she was the assistant to Shari's lawyer \[...\] She said that we needed to talk about Shari's lawsuit \[...\] I don't think that woman was Shari \[...\] A few days later, I received another call \[...\] The woman then said that I could ""get money out of"" the Laurent family \[...\] The woman then called my a ""b\*\*ch"", said ""f\*\*k the Laurents"".  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;I received another call \[...\] a man said, ""is this f\*\*king \[REDACTED\]?"" in an aggressive and threatening tone \[...\] the man then said I ""need\[ed\] to be united with Shari"" so that ""all this lawsuit shit can come to a conclusion"" \[...\] The man then told me ""I know where you live"" \[...\] I am not sure who the man and woman were, but I think that Shari gave them my number and told them to call and intimidate me. I'm scared that Shari will escalate these threats \[...\] When I got these calls, I told Mr. Laurent and his wife because I was worried about them and their three little kids. I wasn't sure what Shari might do next.

Currently we have just lee sin and evelynn, which are usually one trick champs, and are from 2019(!)

With the new prestige update including champs like lulu, pantheon, zed, jax, and sylas, there was not one jungle champ included, unless Riot makes sylas or pantheon viable for jungle again (which is highly unlikely considering how oppressive their flex potential was in high levels of play)

I think a lot of jungle mains would appreciate a prestige skin for a popular jg champ like elise, graves, kayn, etc. that don’t require one tricking

t3_m84vhi,Do you actually enjoy soloq? - My current problems with it,"I'm not talking about the game itself, I'm talking about soloq specifically. League is obviously fun.

Personally I think riot has let a ticking time bomb alone for the past few years, turning a blind eye on high elo player behavior. I played 6 games today and 3 of them had people intentionally feed, sell items at 9 minutes, or afk. People in high elo know how to just avoid the systems that deal with these issues and riot is doing nothing about it. 

The report system is archaic and only works for people who don't know the boundaries (dying 18+ times, actually leaving the game, saying very bad words)

For me, winning soloq is about having less mentally unstable teammates than the enemy. The slightest setback will make people lose their mind and completely ruin the game.

It doesn't help that queuing to ACTUALLY play a game takes a year or two. People find soloq so unfun that it takes 10-20 minutes to even have a queue pop on 200lp EUNE. Nobody (including me) can be bothered to play more than what we must play to avoid decay.

Meanwhile theres a seemingly 70% chance the lobby is dodged because either someone threatens to feed, or an OTP got his champ banned, or theres funnel (seriously? this is still a thing?), or at least 1 out of the 10 players in the lobby is trying to minmax his 50% winrate mmr by dodging bad teammates/teamcomps.

To sum up, I do not think soloq is fun at all. There's so many things that distract from the actual game itself that makes soloq not even about playing the game. You either have people give up on trying to play it completely (decay gamers) or people who turn their senses off and autopilot 15 games a day, ending the season with 3k games 50% winrate. So it turns out that soloq players just dont care about the game.

t3_m7k8sz,"LPL's seeding race, matches to watch in Week 10 and who I think will win it all","While LEC and LCS are in playoffs and mid-season showdown (or whatever it's called), LPL is coming to Week 10 with 6 teams in contention for 3 playoff spots and 5 teams with the same amount of wins fighting for 2nd seed. Many of you may be new to LPL, so I thought I'd spend a little bit of my time to talk about why I think the last week of LPL will provide some of the best competitive LoL and who I think will make it to playoffs/top 2 or 4.

**Matches to watch:**

**Top Esports vs Royal Never Give Up 3.20 05:00 ET/09:00 GMT**

**Royal Never Give Up vs Rare Atom 3.22 05:00 ET/09:00 GMT**

**Edward Gaming vs Team WE 3.24 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT**

**Top Esports vs Team WE 3.27 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT**

**Edward Gaming vs Rare Atom 3.29 07:00 ET/11:00 GMT (literally last game of the split)**

Every single one of these games could affect the standings of the top seven teams, and therefore affect the seeding and possible the championship points they're guaranteed to get. I talk more about the current standings and who I think will make it below!

**Seeding**

The top 7 teams have all made it into the playoffs but none of the seedings have been confirmed and the rankings can completely shuffle within the last week. The final rankings will decide their seeding in playoffs and how many games they get to skip. Week 10 of LPL will be an exciting one to say the least.

||Team|Series|Games Differential|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1st\*\*\*|Royal Never Give Up (RNG)|11-2|\+15|
|2nd\*\*\*|Edward Gaming (EDG)|10-3|\+14|
|3rd\*\*|Top Esports (TES)|10-3|\+13|
|4th\*\*|Team WE (WE)|10-3|\+11|
|5th\*|FunPlus Phoenix (FPX)|10-4|\+13|
|6th\*|Rare Atom (RA)|10-4|\+10|
|7th|JD Gaming (JDG)|9-4|\+9|

\*\*\*Round 4 Seed (Skips 3 games)  
\*\*Round 3 Seed (Skips 2 games)  
\*Round 2 Seed (Skips 1 game)

Because of how close the top 7 is, literally every single map matters in every single series, and there is absolutely no slacking. Some might argue that seeding doesn't matter, but with how strong some of potential 1st,2nd,3rd seed is, the higher seeding you can get, the more likely you'll be able to get championship points, especially when getting top 2 in the split will **guarantee** you championship points even if you don't win a single game in playoffs. My prediction below is completely **my opinion**, which has some sort of bias, but I tried my best to give objective judgements. Based on my prediction, only two teams will remain in their spot, and teams will change about 10 ranks in total. I also included what I think is the lowest/highest they can get. I believe 2nd-6th place teams will all have the same record, and it will depend on game differential and H2H record.

**1st\*\*\* -** &gt;!Top Esports (13-3, GD: +17)!&lt;

**Upcoming Matches (Spoilers are my predictions)**:

vs RNG (1st) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs TT (15th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs WE (4th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st\*\*\***

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team had an average start to the split despite everyone's expectations, but they have managed to climb back up with an 7 win streak (ongoing). They have shown consistency against some of the best teams and I think they will end up 1st by beating RNG. However, if they lose this game, not only will they drop to 3rd, they could actually end up being 7th if they also lose against WE. Unlikely, but possible.  


**2nd -** &gt;!Edward Gaming (12-4, GD: +16)!&lt;

vs eStar (16th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs WE (4th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs RA (6th) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team has been top 2 in LPL for the past five weeks and I don't see this changing after the last three games. I even predicted them to lose against RA and they would still end up 2nd, but because of how close it is at the top, if they lose against WE, they can still end up 7th. They'll most likely end up 2nd or 3rd depending on game differential.

**3rd -** &gt;!Royal Never Give Up (12-4, GD: +15)!&lt;

vs TES (3rd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs RA (6th) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs LGD (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 5th**

Similar to EDG, they have never dropped out of the top 3, being consistently good and having only lost to BLG and JDG. However, their recent struggles against top teams (0-2 JDG, 2-1 EDG) have shown that their champion pool and playstyle are rather rigid, and they'll most likely save most of their picks for playoffs, which is why I predicted them to lose against both RA and TES, finishing 3rd. I could be completely wrong and they could end up 14-2, but I think they'll at least drop one series in the last three, ending up 2nd or 3rd.

**4th -** &gt;!Funplus Phoenix (12-4, GD: +15)!&lt;

vs V5 (12th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs BLG (11th) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 2nd**

**Lowest Finish: 4th**

This team is in quite an unfortunate situation, losing one of the best rookies due to the matchfixing scandal and having to play with an academy jungler that went pro 2 months ago. Nonetheless, their team is extremely strong and should pick up easy wins against V5 and BLG. Their standing will depend on their winning margin but because of their current record, it is almost impossible for them to finish 1st.

**5th -** &gt;!JD Gaming (12-4, GD: +14)!&lt;

vs LNG (9h) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs LGD (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs OMG (14th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 5th**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

Despite their early inconsistencies, this team is a strong team, and in combination with their easy schedule, this team should end up 5th. There shouldn't be much discussion but it's possible that they drop a game and fall to 7th but they should sit comfortably at 5th.

**6th -**&gt;!Rare Atom (12-4, GD +12)!&lt;

vs RNG (1st) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

vs EDG (2nd) &gt;!2-1 Win!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 4th**

**Lowest Finish: 7th**

This team is in an interesting situation, because they technically could end up 2nd if they 2-0 both of their games against the top 2 teams (atm). Before their 1-2 loss against LGD, RA was on a 7 win streak and almost all Chinese streamers/casters thought that they were at least top 2, or even the best, in LPL. This team was in discussion of whether or not they can finish 1st, but after their piss poor performance against LGD and their terrible game differential, the highest they could finish is 4th, and that requires extreme luck from the other top teams to lose/win games in their favour.

**7th -** &gt;!Team WE (11-5, GD: +11)!&lt;

vs BLG (13th) &gt;!2-0 Win!&lt;

vs EDG (2nd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

vs TES (3rd) &gt;!1-2 Loss!&lt;

**Highest Finish: 1st**

**Lowest Finish: 7th** 

This team being here is probably a shocker, especially after their 5-0 start to the split, but if they can't beat either EDG or TES, they'll most likely be 7th (unless JDG throws). With such a young and new roster, no matter what place they end they'll probably be happy with it and aim to improve to make it to worlds this year. They theoretically can make it to 1st, but that would require them to beat EDG and TES, and RNG to win against TES or RA, which is quite unlikely. Possible, but unlikely.

TL:DR

Week 10 will be an absolute blood bath, where a single team could change every team's ranking in the top 7. EDG and RNG will be extremely like to be top 3, but apart from that literally **anything** could happen. It is theoretically possible for anyone to finish 1st and also anyone to finish 7th. If you have time, watch some of the matches I mentioned at the beginning, you'll see high level league of legends alongside likely throws and ints by each team.

I'll also make one for the playoffs race but it's definitely not as exciting as the top seven.",leagueoflegends
t3_m7s56j,Practice Tool needs more features to make it more interesting,"[Practice Tool](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Practice_Tool#Commands_1) is the best tool for practicing and testing champs. However there are some things that need to be added or changed.

Here are the features that we may want to request:

# #1 Switching champions + skins during the game

Lots of us will get annoyed when testing various of champs by exiting the game. Everytime we want to change between champions to practice, this will be time-consuming to recreate other games. Also the computer will work a lot to load a game many times.

DOTA 2 already has this feature too but it uses different game engine. The problem with this feature for the Riot Games development team is: this game may has to load all 150+ champions. The computer has to decompress the whole packed files and load them into the game which is something...obvious.

# #2 Changing rune pages + summoner spells in game

Similar to feature #1, if there are some keystones can stack infinitely like Dark Harvest or Grasp of the Undying, changing runes will lose the stack.

# #3 Changing dummies to specific champs + control dummies

In order to make Practice Tool more interesting, we can assign specific champs to play with. I have played Nami and Lulu to see how allies do but they didn't do anything. The dummies we really want that can move, dodge skillshots and interact to each other like human or bot play. We can duplicate the same champs to make it look like One for All game mode, sound interesting right?

Also in DOTA 2, the players can fully the dummy heroes such as using abilities, leveling up and buying items. If Riot Games can add this feature, players may want to test how tanky it is when getting damage (not the turrets and fountain).

Here is the link to illustrate that feature: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglt1-Jthek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iglt1-Jthek)

# #4 Hosting a Practice Tool game need to be offline + remove 60 minutes cap

When using Practice Tool, I don't really know why the game need to connect to server meanwhile only us can play this tool alone. Some players who play with poor internet speed will notice this. Connecting to server is one of the main reasons why the game limits to 60 minutes to reduce the server's stress when gathering info too much.

The 60 minutes limit is also a problem, if we use Fast Forward 10 min too much, we cannot have enough time to test for longer. Also we want to test how Bard collecting chimes or how [Gathering Storm](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Gathering_Storm) look like after 70, 80, 90 mins.

# #5 Restore destroyed turrets + inhibitors

# #6 Some champions' abilities cannot refresh cooldown when using Auto-Refresh Cooldowns

I don't know whether this is a bug or not.

* When using Sylas \[R\] to steal ultimate abilities, there is an only bot champ that he can steal. The cooldown when stealing the same champ cannot be reset.
* Kindred is more painful, her passive cannot select the dummies for hunting so I have to fast forward every 4 minutes to hunt the same bot. Due to 60 mins limit, this will be a problem for players who are curious about how Kindred will look like when stacking a lot of hunting marks.

There are more of them but I cannot test them all.

t3_m7molx,TES and JDG: Thrones Reclaimed in the LPL,"**A Renewed Rise**

After some underperforming finishes for both Top Esports and JD Gaming at last year’s 2020 World Championship, many eyes were on these two mostly unchanged rosters to once again dominate the 2021 LPL in the same fashion that defined the previous year. Such expectations however, felt off. By the end of Week 5, halfway through the LPL, it seemed as if both of the titans had hit a hard wall; TES sat in 11th place, humbled by a loss even to the 17th place Rogue Warriors - with that series still being the only series RW has won in 2021 - and JDG similarly struggling to step into form, being dealt tough losses from other contenders EDG, IG, and a subpar-form TES. 

Yet, as it stands coming into the final stretch of LPL regulation, both teams are looking to once again shove their weight into deep playoff runs. How did such a bleak outlook halfway through the season turn into such hope only 4 weeks later? 

**The Die with Nine Faces, and the Frontline ADC**

Top Esports was a team that nobody expected to be in the place they were. Starting out the gate with a 3-3 record, many began to question the viability of the roster, particularly the spot of toplaner Bai “369” Jiahao. A player frequently meme’d as rolling a three, six, or a nine on the day, the early stretch of the split saw him consistently hit the lowest end of the trifecta, worrying many fans that the cohesion of the squad might be in jeopardy. 

However, when the team needed nines the most, 369 would make sure to deliver. Starting from that 3-3 position, he would go on to not just roll onto nines, but also roll OVER many of the opposing toplaners he would face, pushing TES onto a 7 series win streak and securing himself 7 MVPs - tying him for the 3rd highest in the league with the likes of Viper and Wei. 

Meanwhile at bot lane, Yu ""JackeyLove"" Wenbo continued his trademark flash-in, brave playing style which netted a large portion of teamfight wins. The constant dishing out damage, kiting, and fancy footwork noticeably returned to legendary status over recent weeks. Off the backs of both 369 and JackeyLove, Top Esports would go on to inflict crippling blows to the contending EDG and storied IG - and are once again looking to cement themselves as a cornerstone of the LPL.

**The Slow Start Squad Zooms Forward**

For those who follow the LPL closely, JDG’s start should not come as a huge surprise. They are a team well known at this point for being plagued with early season issues; in 2020 Spring they started out 5-4 before finishing 12-4, and in 2020 Summer they would start out to a 9th placed 3-2, only to finish 12-3.

This split is no different. Starting out 2-3, the squad now finds themselves 9-4, and on the road to contesting in the race to a top 2 finish. Powered by yet another rock in the toplane, the tenacity of Zhang “Zoom” Xingran gave JDG the time and space required to iron out the issues plaguing the rest of the roster, particularly in the botlane. Sitting at six MVP awards, much higher than any other member of JDG, this high class roster is searching for yet another repeat of their LPL title, and is hungry for another chance to prove themselves internationally.",leagueoflegends

t3_m8c7s0,how mentally old do you think low Elo players are?,"just had a game as nasus top. played pretty defensive. I had something like 1/2 against a 9/2 vayne top for the first 15 minutes. in those 15 minutes my jungler never helped me. he only went once top when i was dead. killed all minions, attacked tower and died to vayne. while the others i think tried to help protect the tower when i was in spawn, but they died even at 2v1 feeding vayne more. i never insulted the whole game or spammed the pings. i didn't talk for half the game. the only think i said was thank you for help when i saw a teammate standing on tower while i was fighting with yasuo, i was almost under tower. maybe if she helped me we could have gotten a kill and retreat before enemy came. 

near the end of the game people started being toxic pushing the blame on me. when the game was over they trash talked me and said report while EVEN the enemy team was defending me saying they cant blame me and its not my fault. I'm a bronze player, i know i could have done better but in that game i did play like a turtle trying to not feed and only attacking when i had backup. so idk why they would blame it at me. i dont think they were premade

i feel like 80% of the people find are kids that cant accept the fact that you cant always win.

I understand the need for feature parity on all similarly priced skins (this is only 1350, new animations are reserved for 1820+ skins) but it doesn’t feel great to release a preview for a skin with animations that then get removed. Still a great skin though, that recall is incredible.

t3_m7xes3,Why are Top Lane Matchups so 1 sided?,"I know this seems like a silly question at first glance, however, hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've bounced around playing a few different roles over the last 6-7 years, not only trying to have fun, but also climb the elo ladder.  I recently was moved to the Top Lane on a competitive team after moving from ADC as I used to main top a few seasons ago.  I don't know if this is a new thing, as I don't remember it being as terribly one sided, but the counter picks seem so heavy in one direction compared to other lanes.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I go and look at my match history and check which games I was fortunate enough to not have to first pick top (before they pick their top laner), my winrates are relatively high.  However, whenever I have to first pick my champion in Solo-Q, my winrate moves down to nearly 20%.  It feels that if you get counter-picked top lane, you actually can not play the game.  You are expected to either be 2 levels down and down 50 CS at 10 minutes, or you just perma-int if you actually try to fight.  The only exception I've found is just when playing tanks.  Why are these matchups so skewed in one direction? It makes playing and even practicing top lane such a chore.  I loved playing other roles, however, I'm finding myself truly hating the game as I play Top Lane.",leagueoflegends
t3_m83os5,Amateur League with variety of prizes for Silver-Gold and Plat-D4 players," Hey!

I will be organizing an amateur League for players from EUW/EUNE and NA all details can be found below.

**Tournament Rules**

There will be two separate leagues. Teams will be drafted randomly from a pool of the available players. The size of the tournament will depend on the number of available players.

**Rewards**

For the winners of the tournament:

* 25$ RP for each participant
* Free BE smurfs
* Free coaching session live or replay review for each participant.

For the 2nd place:

* Free BE smurfs
* Free coaching session live or replay review for each participant.

For the 3rd &amp; 4th place:

* Free BE smurfs

The final 4 teams will be assigned a professional coach

**Requirements to join**

In order to prevent smurfs from disrupting the tournament following requirements must be met to join.

* At least level 100 account
* Prior ranked experience in the last 3 years
* Clash participants will have priority in joining, because of verified phone number.

We reserve the right to remove any player that is obviously not in the elo he claimed to be.

**Leagues**

We will organize two separate leagues but this might change in the feature depending on the engagement.

* Silver 4 to Gold 1
* Platinum 4 to Diamond 4

**Progression of the tournament**

The tournament isn't simply supposed to reveal which team is the best. Instead, we want to create a competitive environment that promotes learning and we believe that building a community of fellow students is the best way to do that.

**That's why our tournament will consist of two stages:**

Learning stage during which teams scrim against each other for 2 weeks and have a game of their choice reviewed by a coach once a week. We will also answer your questions in the chat if you have any.

Tournament during which teams play in double round-robin if there are 10 teams per league or single round-robin if there are more than 10 teams. Semifinalists will be assigned a permanent coach for the remaining part of the tournament.

Would be nice to see what the enemy team has for their runes. Runes such as zombie ward can be pretty important to know the enemy is running and not to feed them ward kills, especially early on. Knowing if your opponent is running tenacity can also be huge in certain match ups.

I know 3rd party websites can give this info, but it should be in the client itself, and I don't think it'd be hard to do.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7g860,"New Voice Lines For Zyra, Written By Me","Zyra is in a fairly awkward, but not necessarily unique position among the League roster. Like many other champions, her model, VFX, and lore are all up to date, or at the very least passable. However, what keeps her and many other champions from being entirely modern is the extensive voice lines reworked and newer champions have. What does make Zyra's situation a bit more nuanced is that her current voice over by no means conflicts with her lore like other older champions, mostly because it's all just generic empty lines relating to plants. So, I'm really only adding special interaction lines, such as with champions, objectives, kills, etc.

With Zyra, in lore she's portrayed as this untamed seductress, like a sexy venus flytrap for lack of a better example, luring you in with beautiful flowers and intoxicating aromas, only to unleash her fury the moment she has you. With that in mind, when writing these I was trying to get on that fine line where she wouldn't sound to much like LeBlanc or Evelynn, League's other resident seductresses. I also wanted to capture this sort of hunter/predator aspect she's always had, displaying that wild hunger that has carried through her characterization as nature's wrath. Most importantly, I wanted her to sound distinct from Poison Ivy of DC Comics, a character she may as well be a parody of, so I also attempted to incorporate how truly ancient and alien is.

For anybody who isn't up to date with the current iteration of her lore or is unaware of it, here's the link to her universe page,  [https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en\_US/champion/zyra/](https://universe.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/champion/zyra/)

**FIRST MOVE**

""Unrooted, I'll stalk this world the way animals do, feet above the soil and talons drawn.""

""Soon this realm will be a garden of paradise, not mine but ours, free of hate and war.""

""The earth has already been seeded, now I just need the.. proper nourishment.""

""They'll ignore the vines around their ankles 'til the thorns are at their neck, but by then it'll be to late.""

""The humans cling to their metals and stone, underestimating the strength of every petal, leaf, and stem.""

""I shall cultivate for them a most wondrous death, a bloom of colors that leaves them longing for more.""

""Air in my lungs, rain on my skin, I'm neither flora or fauna.. I'm.. me.""

**FIRST ENCOUNTERS**

Ivern ""How far you've fallen, there's barely any trace of you left, God-Willow.""

Maokai ""You brought it on yourself by trusting those vermin to begin with, Maokai.""

Lillia ""Sweet Lillia, their blood will nourish the roots more than their dreams. Let me show you.""

Qiyana ""There's a crown just for you, darling. Grown from thorns.""

Hunter Champions (e.g. Rengar, Nidalee, Kai'sa, etc.) ""A fellow hunter? \**hungry moan\** I'll savor the chase."" / ""Not all hunters are flesh and bone, listen to the wilds and learn.""

Ixtali Champions ""You're merely shaping shrubs while the roots grow wild beneath you."" / ""\**chuckles*\* Such arrogance, to think I'm a flower for you to prune.""

Black Rose Champions ""You grace the rose with your poise, but how will you feed her?""

Human Champions ""Be you predator or prey? All I see is a treat."" / ""Little children, fumbling through the world and destroying all they touch."" / ""Focus on the aroma, the petals against your cheek, it makes what comes next easier."" /

Spirit Champions (e.g. Tahm Kench, Janna, Evelynn, etc.) ""Leave this world, it doesn't belong to you."" / ""Tainting all you touch, not respecting the space you invade, it disgusts the natural.""

**LONG MOVEMENT**

""Hundreds of beings forced into a singular form, thousands of memories flooded into one mind, it hurts to think. I never had to think before.""

""They call me monster, but is the snake a monster for preying on the frog? It's only following it's instincts.""

""There was only hunger before, fear and rage, but now there's more.. what does one do with hope? With regret? With guilt?""

""I recall.. the taste of cooked meat, the sound of a wooden thing with strings, the comforting touch of another against my body.""

""I, *he* left his kin behind, a mate and little ones, there were riches in those swamps he was told, they'd never hunger again. Then.. fire and thorns.""

""Wet soil holding me, nourishing me, sunlight invigorating me, no, not just me, all of us, the roots everywhere, a web, connection, I.. I.. I used to be more, far and wide.""

""Pain, wet, sore, thorns around my ankles, the men are screaming, mind racing, 'I will not fall like this! This isn't how I die!' \**gasps\** The woman, the catalyst.""

""Feeding, growing, spreading, there is only one path and it will never end, never be enough. Not until I'm everywhere.""

""How do the mortals do it I wonder, so removed from their own world? To not feel the grass sing, the trees cry, and the flowers laugh."" 

""Morality is a construct grown by humans, used to navigate their short lives. Survival is all that matters.""  

**ATTACKING** 

Ivern ""This abomination will not stand!"" 

Maokai ""Nothing left but rot!"" 

Lillia ""Dream little sprout."" 

Ixtali Champions ""Consumed by the jungle you hide in!"" / ""Your Empire will fall!""

Humans Champions ""Return to the soil!"" / ""Little vermin!""/ ""Nothing but fertilizer!"" / Know your place!"" 

**KILLS**  

Ivern ""You will be reborn in the next age, God-Willow."" 

Maokai ""I will see life returned to the Shadow Isles, Maokai.""

Human Champions ""Where you fell, new life will sprout."" / ""The cycle continues."" / ""Nature always wins."" / ""A bountiful harvest."" / ""Be with the colors, darling."" 

**DESTROYING A STRUCTURE**

""Each construct broken is another step returned to nature."" 

""In time, all the world will crumble before my vines."" 

""Stone breaks and cracks while the grass grows and the roots run deeper."" 

""Their kingdoms will fall, their walls will topple, and my growth will flourish."" 

""A tree had fallen for this *thing* to stand, but even it cannot weather the seasons.""",leagueoflegends

I am currently in low masters on NA (~100LP) and can't duo. That's not a big issue for me, but it becomes extremely frustrating when I go against D1 duos several games in a row. In theory that might seem fair, but oftentimes the duo will have an 80% winrate and the players will be as skilled as if not moreso than I am on an individual level, which leads to me getting crushed easily by their coordination as a solo mid player.

t3_m6vpzj,Alphari has finished the split with possibly the highest gold differential at 10 minute in LCS history,"Obviously this only includes players who played a full (or even nearly full) split.

To put this in perspective for this split, the second highest top laner is Finn with +35, and the second highest at any position is Huhi with +313.

Of players who played the entire split, the next highest GD10 that I can find **at any position** was Blaber in summer of 2020 at +370. For most splits, the highest was a little over +300. Unfortunately, Oracleselixir only has complete stats going back to summer of 2014, so it's possible that someone on Cloud 9 in summer of 2013 did better given how dominant they were.

Alphari's CSD10 is second highest in LCS history (excluding supports) at +12.5, topped only by Huni in spring of 2016 at +13.1. An absolutely insane split from Alphari.",leagueoflegends

t3_m88v6m,Tank “TEAR” item path.,"I’ve been using tear for almost any champ lately as a first item, Illaoi for example. I searched the internet and found a post for an idea of a tank/bruiser tear item build. But that was 3 years ago. Does anyone else think this would be awesome and if yes what would you want it to be? 

I personally think a mana item with armor, MR and % health based on mana would be sweet. Maybe similar to gargoyles but mana ratio instead of shield. 

This would give mana hungry tank/bruisers a starter item path but it would be finished later into a well rounded tanky item.

How Riot handles the T2 scene? What can you achieve outside T1 ?

1. The teammates I get in Ranked- I like to think I'm a pretty decent League of Legends player. I'm currently s3 peaked s1 80lp. recently I have had a spike in games where I have had one or more teammates that just seems like they aren't playing to win. Which confuses me on how they are even in a game with me and 2 how are they not banned/ don't get banned after the game and I report them? If my Ezereal has 2 KP in a 30 min game and 8k damage obviously something is up. i just wish the matchmaking system was better because it is a team game and one player cant win the game for everyone.
2. The Toxicity in League Of Legends- The amount of times I've had jungle camps stolen, whole minion waves stolen by my jungler, my champs I'm hovering being banned by my teammates and so on is astounding to me. I report these people but I just can't seem to escape them. I really hope riot can figure out a way to get rid of toxic people.

Its going to be 4th year since Riot added nothing better to be exchanged for Honor 5 tokens, even after people being already angry year ago. No one uses these skins, nor the chromas and maybe only mains and collectors want these chromas anyway, not to mention Riot was already saying they will add more options for H5 tokens last time. 

Riot expects people to not be toxic and then makes them toxic but spitting at em with stuff like that LMAO

I think H5 rewards need a change, I think the best option would be to have H5 tokens exchangable for any chroma from the past events, these still would be limited because you can pretty much get only 1 per year but it would be a bit more worth than that and hey, its still a chroma, as we can see Riot LOVES giving these to H5 players :))",leagueoflegends

Re-casts cost no mana and ult is available for 20 seconds. At rank 3 mana cost is removed and kills fully reset CD. The area around target is revealed for 2.5 sec, his ult requires a target.
* ***Pyke*** \- marks, strikes and blinks to an area, which executes (deals true damage to) enemies under a certain amount of health, dealing 50% as physical AOE to other enemies. Additionally split gold with allies and recast at no cost (initial is 100 mana). Partial damage applies if target is not under threshold. Has an indicator to tell you when to ult, requires no target
* ***Viego*** \- gains displacement immunity, then blinks to a location, dealing AOE damage which also scales off crit. It knocks back all enemies but 1 (either the lowest health target or closest), whom receives bonus damage based off their missing health, is slowed by  99% for .5 sec, and receives an application of all on hit effects. When Viego posses a soul he becomes untargetable for 1 second, blinks a second time to the soul's location, and heals for a minimum of 8% target's maximum hp.  There is a 1.5 second delay between ult resets. There is no indicator, ult does not require a target or any mana at all levels.

t3_m89k2j,The new battle academia Caitlyn skin is sadly really underwhelming.,"Basically what the title says. So I get home from a long day of work and I'm super excited to buy and try out the new legendary Caitlyn skin and after one game I feel really let down. I don't know if it's because the quality of recent legendary skins has been so exceptional that the bar was set really high but battle academia Caitlyn really just feels like a glorified 1350rp skin. Don't get me wrong, the new emotes, home guard, and voice lines are cool but that's something that's just come to be expected with all 1820rp skins. Like when you really get down to it, the only things that make this skin even somewhat stand out as a legendary is the added anime overlay when ulting and the ""gun transformations"". And both of those are extremely underwhelming when thinking about other skins like Katarinas legendary skin and how your blade transformations are actually noticeably different and make your abilities different colors. Even the legendary Ezreal skin that came out tHree years ago has noticeable changes with his passive. Meanwhile, Caitlyn has three lousy gun transformations, that to be quite honest, aren't noticeable at all, and I've still yet to see them change abilities or autos in any way. And that just leaves the upgraded ult, which is admittedly kind of cool in theory, but considering the overlay lasts for approximately 1.5 seconds I don't see how it can justify this skin being worth 1820rp. I don't know, I might just be comparing this skin to other legendaries too much, but with all the recent legandaries I feel like the standards are just so much higher than what this skin delivered. Maybe if the gun transformations had noticeable impacts on the skin it would be totally worth it but I don't know. I'm curious to know what you guys think though, am I being overdramatic?

t3_m78j4w,"I genuinely think that the game would be better if everyone would be permanently ""chat restricted""","What I mean by that is that everyone should always have limited messeges they can send, just like when you are chat restricted. It could be something like:

* Maximum messeges: 3. Start with 3. Gain an additional message: every 60 seconds.
* Or maximum messeges: 5. Start with 3. Gain an additional message: every 120 seconds.

Currently, games turn into flame fest really fast, for example, top and jungler or bot lane flaming each other. All it takes is someone type something negative, then the other person gets triggered and never ending flaming cycle begins. It feels like 90% of all messeges typed in chat are actually someone flaming each other or spamming ""FF15"" every time they die and only 10% are something positive / useful. Overall, this not only makes them perform worse because they are too busy typing but also drops morale of whole team.

**And please, don't tell me ""juST diSAblE CHat""** or **""/muTE aLL"".** This doesn't help, when I'm not the one participating in it, I can't stop my teammates playing ***Keyboard Warriors*** instead of ***League of Legends.*** The best thing I can do is say ""Please calm down and play"" but most of the time that doesn't help, sometimes it even makes it worse...

If everyone would have limited messeges, they just couldn't non-stop flame even if they wanted to. For non-toxic players, it wouldn't change much, because they wouldn't waste messeges flaming, so they'd have enough of them whenever they need it.

TL;DR: Just read the title.

**EDIT** (I just woke up and after reading all comments, I decided to address a few most common replies)**:**

* The amount of toxic replies in this post only proves that most people in this community are just toxic and fast to insult, rather than actually trying to have a healthy conversation.
* Most of the people reply after reading the title only and say ""counter-arguements"" that I have already addressed in my post. **I'LL REPEAT MYSELF:**
   * No, I'm not a thin skinned person and yes, I know where to find mute buttons but what if I told you that it doesn't stop my teammates from typing! Did you know that?!
* The only good counter-arguement is that people like to time summoner's spells in chat. However, I never said that this idea is 100% perfect and has no flaws. Obviously, it should be adjusted. For example, you would have higher messeges limit / have them recharge more quickly but every time you get reported, it would reduce this limit / recharge time. **THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM BECAUSE** currently, if you don't say any trigger words, you'll probably never gonna get chat restricted, meanwhile, with this system, annoying people who spam ""ff15"", ""go next"" and so on, would often get reported and punished. Meanwhile, people who rarely or never get reported, they have plenty of messeges for all their needs.
* Following my previously point, yes, I can agree that my suggestion was a bit too extreme but my main point is to increase the amount of people having unlimited access to the chat.
* **For people saying ""If they couldn't chat, they would just run it down instead or grief you in other ways""**. If the player is non-stop typing, he's already griefing. Quite often I see people dying while typing, not even to mention that the person is distracted and not thinking about how to win the game because he's too busy thinking of a creative way to insult other person. Moreover, most people won't hardcore grief because they actually care about their precious LP, meanwhile, as I already said, they actually grief by non-stop chatting without even realising it.
* **FOR PEOPLE SAYING ""imAGinE RedUCinG ChaT In cOMpeTItiVE TEam GAme"".** Just ask yourself, how often does anyone say something useful in the chat?! Because I see that like 1 useful messege per 5 minutes...

Due to the LPL skipping 11.4 entirely in pro play, I will say that this post is pretty weak. The LCK were using 11.4 through last week, and began on 11.5 today. 

I am staying true to posting each patch, regardless of the amount of material though. ( I already can say there are more for 11.5). There were only three individual champion matchups that occurred more than 10 times. I give some stats on those as I normally do, with win rates in pro vs win rates in solo queue. Lastly, I did include matchups that were the most common at each role without stats,  even if they did not play 10 times.

As I say every patch, there are countless variables that effect these statistics. These are based on win rates in a vacuum.

t3_m8a5a8,There are currently no good Mana items for Bruisers and no good Grievous Wound magic resist items for Tanks who are up against healing ap damage.,"**Currently, if you are a bruiser (ap or ad), you literally have no good items you can build to help you get more mana.** Triforce no longer gives mana, Lichbane no longer gives mana.

Literally the only items that give mana is Frozen heart, which is a very niiche (and understat) tank item. 

**And if you want magic resist and mana as a bruiser or a tank, you don't have any option to do so.** (having mana used to mean something, now it feels like a huge disadvantage when we have fking manaless champs everywhere)

Banshee's stopped giving mana ages ago, abyssal helm no longer gives mana and is absolute trash. Heck most magic resist items that aren't mythic items or Gargoyle's Stoneplate are absolute trash

**And for Tanks who are fighting  healing AP damage, you have nothing to defend yourselves with.**

If you are facing Cassiopiea, or Sylas, or Vlad, or Swain, you're pretty fucked. They just heal off abilities and don't auto you and theres nothing you can do about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bramble's Vest should build from an HP crystal and inflict Grievous Wounds if you are hit by an auto or a single target ability (or skill shot that affects a single target)

Then it should split off into two items, one which is thornmail and the other which is magic resist thornmail equivalent that grants grevious wounds if you are in combat with said champion for more than 4 or 5 seconds.

He left behind his alienation and torment in his homeland in seek of a power that would allow him to be respected once more. On his journey across Demacia he encounters a being of pure faith and truth, or so he says. This being agrees to give Stauf courage and strength greater than that of any man, in exchange, this being requests a strange thing. His death. Confused, Stauf looks up at the being, only to notice it’s eyes were now open. Eyes of raw hatred, belonging to a Darkin. 
Stauf screams in agony as the Darkin gouges out his eyes, replacing them with his own. “You will  see nothing but mortals falling at your gaze...”
... Stauf stirs awake. Darkness. As if he entered the void. Anger. Zen. Fear. Confidence. What was he feeling? Even he could not tell. As he looked around he noticed a being passing by, engulfed in a bright orange flame. A person? King? Peasant? Good? Evil? He could not tell. “Serve your purpose...” It echoed in his mind. He could not deny.  He sprinted towards the flame, faster than any living creature could possibly move, slamming it to the ground. “Gaze, into your own hell...” 

Passive - Behold, The Darkin

(AD, MR, and Armor increase per level)

Stauf is empowered by the spirit of the Darkin, craving battle and carnage. Stauf gains a stack every time he is damaged by  or damages a champion, giving him AD and Armor based on how many stacks he has (max 5 stacks, expiring after 8 seconds out of combat) Upon reaching 5 stacks, the Darkin gives all his might into his next attack, dealing bonus damage and applying lifesteal based on how fast Stauf acquired the stacks of Behold, The Darkin. After he attacks, the stacks are reset and put on a 3 second cooldown.

Q - Abhorrence

(CD 12/10.5/9/7.5/6)
(Damage 30/50/70/90/130 75%AD)

Stauf lashes out in disgust, damaging and slowing enemies in a reverse cone (think cone hitbox, but with the wide end closer to Stauf, thinking about same range as Galio Q) applying lifesteal at 50% effectiveness and marking enemies he hit. If the marked enemy is hit by Oblivion, repeat this abilities damage and slow onto the target.

W - Take the Wheel

CD 20/20/20/20/0

Stauf allows the Darkin to take over, gaining range and additional damage on his abilities, but draining his health over the duration. Stauf loses 10% move speed for the duration of the effect. 

W Passive - The Darkin is furious that enemies dare to damage him, gaining onmivamp based on how long he is in combat. This onmivamp is reset when Behold, The Darkin is reset. However, this passive has no cooldown upon reset.

E - Oblivion 

(CD 17/15.5/14/12.5/11)
(Damage 80-120/90-140/100-180/110-220/120/260)
(Damage to self if 50% of these base values)

Stauf locks in place, charging for 0.5 to 2 seconds, dealing damage to himself based on how long he held the charge. At the end of the duration, he transforms into smoke, instantaneously blinking to a target location dealing damage. This damage is increased based on damage dealt to himself. This ability’s cool down is reduced by 70% after cast if it hits a target marked by [Q]

R - Mark of the Damned

(CD 190/145/100)
(Stun Duration .25/.35/.5)

Stauf spins in a circle forcing all nearby champions to look into his eyes, stunning them for .25 seconds, marking them, Stauf them summons a copy of every marked opponent with 125% attack speed, and +10% movement speed. These copies receive 150% of their normal damage and deal 75% of their normal damage. These copies will then auto

Divine Sunderer + Black Cleaver + Sterak's Gage.

Can you do that? No. And why not? Because flat health will ALWAYS be a better tanking stat than armor and mr are. By the time you hit 3 items with a tank, unless their team has only one type of damage, you have already been forced to specialize in tanking either AD or AP and that leaves you helpless against the other type of damage.

Tanks will never come back to meta unless flat health is nerfed to being an off-tank stat instead of a immortal bruiser one.

t3_m7pof9,Some calculations about the most money efficient way to collect all possible skin in League,"Hey guys, I believe currently there are 1184 skins out there, and I have 266 of them so far.  

I'm aware that re-rolling three skin sharps guarantee a new skin, and I got 200 unique shards right now. So I need  (1184-266)\*3 - 200 = 2554 skin shards in order to reach full collection. Hope my math is correct here.

I did a bit of calculation about the purchasing plans I have: 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bkq1vqiuyrn61.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87a94d127d0b0f8354a0cbdb13bc18c11ff93056

So I used the most expensive bundle for each plan and calculated the unit price for the chest or orbs. The odds of getting a skin shard are from league wiki, I believe the odds are so but correct me if I'm wrong. So at first glance, buying orbs is the cheapest plan, it cost me around 4.2k.

Also, opening orbs has a 4% chance of getting a jackpot, and a jackpot has 3 shards for 70% of the time and 4 shards for the rest, so a reasonable expectation is an orb gives 1+0.04\*(3\*0.7+4\*0.3) = 1.132 shards. Also, buying a 50 orbs bundle gives a pack of 9 shards with 20 chance of 3 extra, with that averaged, the expectation of shards in an orb is 1.32, which's more than my expectation before calculation actually. So the final plan is:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that buying all the skins that are below 750 RP at the store might help a bit if I prefer all orbs plan, there are around 70 skins that below 750RP which I haven't owned. I'm just trying to be lazy here haha.  

So is there any plan besides buying all cheap skins at the store, and purchase orbs until I re-rolled all the skins, that's cheaper? I would really appreciate any improvements to the current plan. I'm really curious about this, I have played league for about 8 years, and rarely done any purchases, it's just my childhood dream to have all the skins in the league LOL.",leagueoflegends

Is this intentional? The patch notes mentioned nothing about those items getting buffed, and even though yes Whip got reduced by 100 gold the mythics getting their combined cost reduced by 100 gold was not mentioned anywhere and is actually insanely huge, especially when Stridebreaker was supposed to get nerfed by 266 gold worth of HP.

Can someone verify a) it's the same for them and b) this is correct or mentioned literally anywhere?

t3_m806a2,"Literally noone is playing AP Ezreal anymore, not even in fun modes","AP Ez has always been a rare sight in Normal 5v5s (let alone Ranked), due to his weak early and non-existent waveclear. However, he was a frequent guest in modes like URF or Dominion (RIP), as the increased gold income and reduced importance of minion scores helped him to reach his power spike quicker. 

His strengths were a *very* strong, but skillshot reliant AoE burst (before the rework) or a very strong singletarget burst plus tower damage (after the rework) in the late mid/lategame. 

But now, after a short period of seeing him with hybrid builds, it seems that I am the only person left playing him. Even in URF people refuse to build anything but AD on him (I think I saw *one* AP Ez in the last ~~AR~~URF rotation).

So, what happened? I believe that the rework (despite Riot preserving his AP ratios) contributed a good part to this development, since the AoE damage of mage Ezreal was what made him different from his AD brother, but it can't be the only explanation. His instant single target burst from his W+E-combo is still way stronger with AP than AD.

Why is nobody playing him anymore?",leagueoflegends

How it works: For the teams, it is simple enough. Each team starts at an elo of 1500, and when they win games, they gain points, and when they lose, they lose points. The gains/losses are larger when there is a larger rating gap between the teams.

Similar applies to the players scores - points are gained/lost based on the average elo score of the opponents faced.

It can take up to 15s to load the data as I'm performing some other calculations atm, but hopefully you enjoy.

auto the first melee minion 2-3 times then q the casters and then hit the casters make sure to get all 6 minions   
push the 2nd wave and hit turret, get 1st plate if ur on botlane   
walk behind t1 turret and drag the cannon wave, do not hit it then just wait in bush near t2 turret until the bots arrive then kill the ezreal if ur bot or nasus if ur top    
if u can go for it kill the 2nd bot if not just walk to lane then perma push and go for kills whenever u can   
once u recall get vamp scepter and then u build this:

do quick tap W to reduce damage from towers   
you can basic attack reset with W   
dont use E before Q, use E instantly after you go out of Q

t3_m7nta6,Question about jungle balance,"hi,

first of all I am not a jungle main, hence I ask.

So my question is about the constant ""jgl gap"" thing.

""gg jgl gap"" has been a huge and disgusting thing for 2 to 3 years now and it has been especially bad this season. Every second to third game is ""jgl gap"". The weird thing is, it has only become worse after the ""jungle nerfs"". I feel like after the jungle nerfs, the ""better"" jgl or the jgler, who had one more opportunity is just unstoppable, outlevels laners and the ""jgl gap jgler"" has 2-4 levels less than the ""better jungler"". I don't want to call out jungle players because I feel like this is not completely their fault. The ""better"" jgl just had one more opportunity (like 1 kill lead early game) and can snowball way too hard with it. In comparison, when somebody dies mid or bot, they have at least a chance to get back up or go even. In jungle the opportunity to come back is way to little. This also applies a bit to top lane I feel, a top laner dies once, and is out of the game, but at least top lane doesn't snowball as hard as jungle. I personally feel the current soloqueue jungle meta is very unhealthy for the game and the community, I may be wrong and this is why I want to ask. Was this always the case? Why is it like this? Can this be fixed? Am I just wrong?",leagueoflegends

Yea there is +- 3 mages with 1% pickrate who can exist there, but they combined have 10x times less playrate than single Kai'sa. Mages are good champs for existing on botlane, but why riot nerfs them every time they showing up and having really playrate?(For example in last season when Cass lose her base armor to push her away from bot), lots of mages RN have problem with doupeel and can feel themself pretty good on bot, but they need last ""push"" from riot to get there.

t3_m82frx,"Make selling items less expensive, or allow swapping of mythics and legendaries.","With the new item reworks and focus on diversity I think it is time to buff selling items. Currently the return on selling items forces you to keep your build even if as time goes on a more optimal build is available. 

In my opinion this woukd fix alot of the issues I currently have with the system. You would have a lot of agency with itemizing to the most fed person, as well as being more experimental with different builds as you could back track if not working as ideal as you thought. 

Of course this would have some drawbacks, as you would itemize in lane much more effectively and then potentially just sell for the broader team play. The playtest team could see if this feels right, or whether it's just a balance with the amounts sound to make it not as oppressive. The other option that could be cool is the ability to pay a fee and swap within item categories, switch for a different mythic on the fly, or switch to the different legendary.

t3_m7vb9j,"I think the biggest problem with Riot's balance team philosophy is, that they are forcing things","It seems like whenever they make some new thing (champion, item, etc.) they want so badly to give an identity to it.. it's so unnecessery and dumb. The best way to learn or understand something is to try this out in a lot of different ways, give it some time and then see what is the actual function of it. 

But instead they create something and say immadetly that it makes ""this"" and it's good for ""this"". Whenever some item or champion is played in a different way than intended, they nerf this as fast as possible and say ""It's toxic for a game"". This kind of thinking kills freedom and variety, which makes things stale, boring and predictable. 

Sure it gets better as time goes on, but still they are doing the same thing over and over.. look at the urgot change from the last patch.

Riot's balance team is like a boring guy who tells everybody how to live because he knows better.. It's like usually they can't see anything besides their own ideas.. it's so lame",leagueoflegends

t3_m84j7v,Why are champions like Yone allowed to exist when compared to ADC,"Yone has literally everything you could ever need to carry a game. Massive damage, multiple forms of CC, all forms of damage, no mana, high scaling, 4 really strong abilities, sustain, shields, double crit chance and gap closers.

What can an ADC do that even somewhat compares to that? Lets take Samira for example. She has good damage, one gap closer on a kill reset only, .75 second W that only blocks projectiles, and her R on a static 8 second cooldown that can be cancelled by any form of CC other than a root. She has no shields, doesn't scale all that well, has mana, only has 1 gap closer that only resets on a kill, has no CC other than off of teammates, and only does physical damage.

ADC is literally short for ""Attack Damage CARRY"" and Samira is supposed to be the ""hyper carry adc"" on top of that. This is coming from someone who plays Yone as well and has experienced this disparity on both sides. If a Yone has 20 kills in a game, the game is pretty much doomed for the enemy team. If Samira has 20 kills, all you need is 1 cc move and she loses because 3/4 of her dmg is from her R. TF, Alistar, Bard, Annie, any of these champions with either super easy skillshots or straight point and click cc just insta kill Samira no matter how fed she is. While someone like Yone, ults into the entire enemy team, does all 3 forms of damage, has 3/4 of his damage on auto attacks and Q which has CC as well, and then E's out and does all that damage for free while sustaining and taking 35% reduced damage when he gets DD.

I love Yone's design don't get me wrong, he's a great champ in the game. But he and many other champions carry WAY easier than the carry role is supposed to. ADC was designed literally to just do the big damage on the team while being peeled for by the rest of the team. When you make a champion that has their own self peel, does more damage than the ADC, scales better than the ADC, benefits from ADC items BETTER than the ADC, and is EASIER to play, why would I even bother playing ADC? What is the entire point of the role at that point?",leagueoflegends

I started a free german coaching series a few months back. I coach 1-2 clients every week. People on my Discord seem to enjoy not just the coachings for themselves but also learning from watching others being coached. It felt like a good time to share so maybe others can also learn from the collected experience of our small community.

t3_m7tgyd,Ignore a lane as a jungler?,"Firstly I want to say that I'm not angry at all, i had this game some days ago so i don't care about its result, basically i was Kata mid, got pretty fed and helped bot, from the start of the game i said to Olaf ( the jungler) that he should help Nasus top because it was a bad matchup (he was vs teemo so his counter), i pretty helped bot getting a double and let them a double but we hard lost the game because Olaf didn't do anything but come bot and get some assists, in the mid game i asked him to help Nasus because he was having an hard time vs teemo (Nasus was 0/4) the answer i got from Olaf was ""he is Nasus,he scales"" lol.
The game end with a teemo hard fed who oneshots me and aphelios with a q or 1 shroom, as i knew nasus in 30 minutes had only 200 stacks so yeah that wasn't a good game, the question is, is it right for a jungler to completely ignore a lane because of the matchup or because the champ scale?",leagueoflegends
t3_m7tbvt,How to be a good support to Ezrael?,"Ok, first of all I would like to say that I'm really not the perfect player, I'm still a noobie that has just played for a month and I'm still trying to inform myself and get advices. Usually I'm a support, I use mainly Morgana and some times my strategy is bad and I can recognize that, but everytime I get paired with an Ezrael I really don't know \*how\* I'm fricking it up.

 I usually play defensive the first levels, especially if the enemy support has a wider range than me or the ability to grab, but the Ezraels I met are always angered by this attitude and start trying to attack enemies and getting mad that it's all my fault for not hitting Q enough and my fault for them dying. Like some of them also started spamming me to leave the lane and I never understand if it would help them to get all the exp from the lane alone or if they're just being toxic. 

So, I'm asking: how to support at the best an adc like Ezrael? Is a more aggressive approach more useful for their style of playing? Which supports you think are better paired with an Ezrael?",leagueoflegends

A little info about me -I am a support main . I have played about 150 games in total this season and a few more on smurf . I play mostly karma lux and Leona. I mostly try to win the lane early as possible with my champions. I play them coz I have fun playing them. I understand playing hook tank supports might be easier to climb with but it still does not solve what I am doing wrong . There are of course a lot of things I don’t know and i am wondering if a challenger told me the things I am doing wrong then would it significantly help my climb? If anyone has please tell me your experience! I will be thankful!

Everyone subestimates the damage of a full Q of Taliyah. If you chase her, she will kite you back as she is singed. Don’t do it

I even clashed with them and we won. I played my part. Still gotta lot to learn tho.

The thing is: every single game I lose in Solo Queue, I lose because one lane (mostly mid against something like katarina) just constantly dies to the point where you can't stop the enemy snwoball. In some cases I even gank a lane at the beginning, get them a 2/0/0 lead and they throw anyway. It happens like every other game and I just don't have the motivation to play anymore.

I’m basically a brand new player when it comes to league. I’ve played a handful of games being my friends support in bottom lane. But he was just telling me my build path and not really explaining why I was building certain items. But I wanna be able to play this game on my own time and hopefully not rely on him so much. But my biggest struggle with this game is item building. I have a ton of experience with mobas from Smite. And building in that game at this point is just second nature to me. But the item shop in LoL just seems so daunting to me. 

I want to play top lane since that’s closest to my main role of Solo in Smite. In smite I tend to player hyper aggressive tanks that just want to pressure the opponent all laning phase then just disrupt the back line in late game team fights. I’ve only played 2-3 games of top lane and proceeded to unintentionally feed/get farmed and got lots of backlash/hate from the other players. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

t3_m81b68,Am i supposed to get worst teammates the the higher i climb?,"as a top laner who currently has around a 70-80 percent wr in g3, there are multiple games where my teammates have a wr way under mine. i believe matchmaking balances teams to around a 50 percent wr, so if you have a 70 percent wr, you might get a teammate with a 30 percent. although, i realize that wr doesn’t matter too often since if you play well, you can affect your teammates. However, when playing top lane i find many games where my teammates completely int on the other side of the map and there’s nothing i can do. me winning lane doesn’t mean anything, if 4 people on the enemy team win their laning phases. so i’m wondering if it’s even possible to consistently climb by playing top lane in low elo. i feel like in higher ranks, no one really completely loses their lane that hard, and games are more decided on team fights rather than which ever team got more fed in the laning phase in the early game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7vtvw,Frustrations of playing ADC in low elo.," 

I am silver 3 adc main, and I'm bad, I won't make excuses, I'll just list some frustrations I've had.

1. All in the supports: of course this is a big exaggeration, but its to get my point across. If you get a worse sup you will lose lane, except if you can 1v2, that's why many adcs like playing with yuumi because if you die, it's your fault but if you make a sick outplay it was almost entirely you.
2. Nobody cares that adcs need help: if I get no peel as an Aphelios, I get completely oneshot and told by my team Im terrible when in fact if they just simply stood in front of me I could you know, deal dmg.
3. Feeling useless until x items: obviously this isnt an adc problem only but tbf all adcs have this problem, you cant 1v1 unless its a pretty specific situation, you cant sidelane because you'll get dove, if you play extra safe you lose farm and scale slower etc.
4. Soloq is nonoq: never I repeat NEVER soloq as an adc as your too team and time reliant to be effective, so duo with either a decent sup or someone who can carry the earlygame and can let you scale into the late.

As a closing thought I wanted to say that I've been grinding my ass off, whatced replayes, tried to learn from streamers, and I just can't climb, I have good cs, I have good dmg, I have few deaths but my win rate is still 50% so if someone could tell me something because im actually going mad from this.

PS: I know most of what I'm saying is either incorrect or phrased incorrectly, but I just want to improve so pls if you have any advice tell me, I just want to get better at this game.",leagueoflegends

Personally, I liked to play viktor top before It became a meta pick for a short time, and the first time I had to deal with it I felt like sadist for putting so many people through that.

I really like pantheon’s kit, it’s awesome in my opinion but i don’t like bruisers that much. I am thinking of playing him as an assassin (i mean is is also an assassin right?) so full lethality and only 2 defensive items (black cleaver and guardian angel) instead of 3/4 defensive items. 

**Can this build work?**

Btw I have a general question about pantheon: I don’t understand if he is only a bruiser or he can be played as an assassin as well (like zed for example). I mean he is supposed to be bruiser/assassin but **based on his kit (no escapes, a stun, a shield that blocks all incoming damage...) he doesn’t look like an assassin at all**. Am I wrong?

Personally, fizz mid for me is a lane where I just always end up chain dying while trying to keep cognizant of the shark, but then I want that one more CS and he just eats me and stomps me alive for many solo kills. But when I watch super high elo play I see he is strategically and mechanically counterable, so not OP, definitely not worth nerfs, but something I really just fear deeply due to my lack of skill against it.

t3_m7yhww,I have just received my new Logitech K/DA gear. This has been my solo queue experience since that day.,"Brandishing my new G305 K/DA LIGHTSPEED WIRELESS GAMING MOUSE, I double click League of Legends. From now on, things will be different.

It’s time to go ALL OUT.

Using my G733 K/DA LIGHTSPEED WIRELESS RGB GAMING HEADSET, I can now appreciate the blood-boiling bass of the “Match Found” sound. It reverberates throughout my whole system. Itching, I begin my performance. “mid pref”, I type, with my PRO K/DA MECHANICAL GAMING KEYBOARD. As I hover Seraphine, my presence immediately becomes known. I feel the ambition in my climb. I want MORE.

Our support player, however, is wired differently. By banning my queen, it felt as if my status was being defied. Instantly, I surge up from my slouch in the SECRETLAB K/DA GAMING CHAIR. Without wasting a moment, I use my PRO K/DA MECHANICAL GAMING KEYBOARD to reign down her wrath in her stead.

No response. It’s something I can take on the cheek, but to insult my queen...

I’m a firm believer that actions speak louder than words. That game, I locked in Lux. My Teemo jungle refused to gank for me. My Ivern top said I “counterpicked” myself. Is that even a word? At the very least, I had the best score of 1/14/2.

t3_m7830r,One thing I wish League would implement is the option to view champion guides with item sets and ability descriptions.,"I've been playing League for over a year now and recently started playing Dota 2, and one method Dota 2 has of catering to newer players (or players trying new Heroes) is that the game gives you the option to download guides made and verified by pro players. The guides can be imported at the start of the game and gives you a custom item set, ability skill order, and ability descriptions. 

https://preview.redd.it/y3bcpgol0nn61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b82f02dcffd253fe9ee9eda1d25b1bfc26695b13

This is much more accessible and even more viable at times than third-party apps from League because the guides visibly highlight what abilities need to be leveled (without needing to tab in and out of third-party apps to confirm skill order) AND they provide you with proper skill descriptions. 

With the new shop update, I think this would be an incredible implementation that would help players on newer champions/ new to the game.",leagueoflegends
t3_m7t390,"With 154 champions, what's the point of build diversity?","Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of situational items like serpents fang and verdant/seekers, but this making Xin able to play AP is something no one asked for.

The game is a lot easier to balance when every champions has a clear identity that is supported by a set of items. This weird ""let's create AP Xin jungle and AP twitch support"" stuff just gives the balance team, who already has to try to balance 154 champions, a harder job. 


Also the vast majority of the time, introducing some new build path with random new ratios one way or the other doesn't introduce diversity, it either creates a new 4fun build that almost never gets used or creates a new primary build for a champion, alienating their playerbase by changing their identity while simply making the previous build inferior, so you don't get a 50/50 AP/AD build split, players pick the most broken one.

I fail to think of a champion that has AP and AD ratios that is equally viable with either. The closest thing I can think of is Twitch, and he gets plays AP much more often.

AD shyvana? Almost never see it.
AP Rengar? Almost never see it unless I'm watching someone like Dekar play gold plat games on stream
AD Xin? Almost never saw it, now I'll probably never see it.
There's plenty of other examples, but it's just silly. 


TL;DR We don't need to try to split champions ratios down the middle to make them able to build every item in the game because :

A) One build always ends up being preferred/stronger, overshadowing the other
B) There's already 154 champions and counting to maintain balance for, there's multiple choices for any niche a player may want to fill (AD assassin, AP assassin etc.)",leagueoflegends

t3_m7o76a,Something Retro for Aatrox,"Hey there everyone!  


Im an Aatrox One Trick from EUNE and I was thinking about creating this post here for some time now. Before you start reading, no this isn't going to be a revert Aatrox post, but more like adding a little ""retro"" stuff for him. As we all know it's been nearly 3 years since Aatrox got Reworked, and a lot have happened since that time. A lot of people started liking and maining him, while in the meantime a lot of the old mains have stopped playing the champion because it got changed way too much both in kit and personality. This is a very old topic yeah I know, but it keeps returning after a while and there is something that I don't really understand about it. Not too long ago in an ASK RIOT post ([https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-lessons-from-dev/](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-lessons-from-dev/)) u/Reav3 talked a bit about Aatrox, but there is the part about the alienation that we heared a lot of times in the past, and it leaves me with one question: If Riot is truly sorry for alienating a lot of the old mains, then why we never really got any sort of compensation in the past? Im not talking about bringing back the old Aatrox as a new champ, but more like creating something like a Traditional Skin for him. This is what my post is really about. As someone who played the old Aatrox a lot and still playing/Maining him after the Rework, I would personally like to play him with a ""Retro"" skin that would have his old voice lines and features like his old horns. wings and sword too just like on this picture: [https://preview.redd.it/0hm80g7lt0661.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0be95babfdc517f6befdaac845d42e06c60f0fa](https://preview.redd.it/0hm80g7lt0661.png?width=1301&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0be95babfdc517f6befdaac845d42e06c60f0fa) (The picture is not made by me). I think this would look awesome on him, as well as it would also bring back a little of his old form while remaining the same in kit to the current one. Furthermore it would also be a nice little compensation for the alienated old mains even after all these years since his rework came out. So what do you guys think? Would it be cool to have a Traditional Aatrox skin and play him with a little retro style?

t3_m7zpzz,Riot's Design Philosophy on the New Generation of Champions and their attitude towards Monster Champions is a cause for concern.,"Besides they are all human (Yes Lillia isn't a human but neither the creature we are missing for long time from the game) and they feel so generic, so one diemnsional like they are targeted for a specific group, not to mention one of the last 8 champions was not designed for the game to make it better just for an event.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a statement from Riot Reav3:  
\**“VGUs totally count when we look at our year roadmap. We still want to make monsters and creatures we just make less of them since they are more niche and when we look at the years roadmap we include VGUs. That being said we have made it a goal to have at least one non-human new champ a year, and we might do more then 1 in a year where we didnt also do VGUs on monster champs. Yuumi was the non-human for 2019 and Lillia is the non-human for 2020. For 2020 though we already knew we were going to ship both Volibear and Fiddle so there wasnt that much room for more monster/creature champs, though we still made Lillia. One of the reasons we chose to make Lillia a whimsical/cute creature was to contrast Voli and Fiddle since we were doing 3 creatures/monster champs in a row. If Shyvana had won the VGU poll, for example, we might have done a new monster champ this year. TL:DR we still want to make creature/monster champs but less since they are niche, and VGUs count towards the amount we make”*

Riot is saying creatures are generally more niche than humans, so they’ll make 1 in a year (2 perhaps if there is no more vgu). - This is straight up lie from their part. They decide them to be nieche. They could give them a kit like any human champion has but they refuse it.

Do you know how many Skirmisher champions there are in League ? (The class that includes Yasuo, Jax and Fiora)? And how many of them are creatures? The answer is 12, and only 2 of them is a creature: Lillia and Kled. Lillia is arguably the most niche in terms of gameplay design of all of them.

Check assassin champions. Out of all assassin (16) champions only 3 are creatures: Fizz, Rengar and Kha’Zix. 4 if we count Nocturne.  
ADC champions ? 24 champions, 5 creatures: Tristana, Kog’Maw, Kindred, Corki and Twitch  
Tanks: 14 Vanguards (9), 6 wardens(3). This side is much better in terms of state than the rest.

What this means. Well we can talk about it after we analyze the more successful creatures since , yes, Riot has created successful, popular creature champions multiple times. And they seemingly just don’t care to factor in to their data for some reason ? Warwick, Malphite, Yuumi, Volibear and Thresh are all prime examples of creatures that endure as popular champions throughout League’s history, and there are other standouts such as Rengar, Hecarim, Kha’Zix.

Feels like Kindred and Aurelion Sol had something to do with this; like how they as champions received huge positive reception for their themes, characterization and the like, but then more or less flopped in the popularity department, and Riot took it hard enough they don’t believe a non-human can be successful regardless of what they do. But this 2 champions right now truly has either very niche style of gameplay or gutted into weakness.

&amp;#x200B;

Bard. One of the most unique and fun support to this day with a kit that allows huge plays.

Tahm Kench: Extremly good tank support or so he used to be because he was continously gutted for having huge presence in esport. He was supposed to get rework last year, he might get it this year.

Kindred: Another extremly fun champion who seen it's own due of nerfs-buffs and minor changes since their kit was allowed such ""niche"" palys that requied changes.

Aurelion Sol: The most fun out all mages. Many player says they want to play him, pick him up but Riot reworked him then nerfed to oblivion so he has no damage early game at all, can't 1v1 in most cases and needs extremly more input, higher level of skills now to play efficiently than what most champions require while existing in an extremly weak state. His win rate is around 52-53% thanks to dedicated mains but statisticly only 0,8-1,1% of the playerbase picks him so compared to that this winrate is actually low. Katarina has around 10% pickrate with 51%-ish winrate just to see compraison.

Kled: Fun top laner who ,along with Bard, is in much better shape than most but Yordle champions are unique among creatures for most them are more playable than other creatures.

Ivern: Another niche jungler who is fun to play but only played by like 2% of playerbase.

Bonus Is Illaoi the only female champion among humans who is the opposite of generic design.

And here is a list of nonhuman races: Ascended, Animals, Darkin, Celestials, Demons, Robots, Undeads, Spirits, Yordles, Voidborns. DRAGONS!?

What I'm trying to say is most creatures designed TO BE niche champion and Riot uses this term as an excuse why they develop less of them. They could design them not to be niche champion. They have a few from that department. It's just looks like they sold creativity of creatures for the simpler and more boring design of humans. Runeterra is a mysterious and vast world with characters that come in many forms and different backgrounds and that's what I like so much about this universe.

When did you dear reader was last excited for a champion reveal ? And if you truly are for every one of them how you felt when they revealed their last creature(s) ? For me it was way more exciting like you. And, no, I do not count Lillia and Yuumi as creatures, not the type what we are all talking about because their cuteness just matches the new ideals which by Riot designs their new releases.

I'm just sad because I miss the time when they were brave and bold and designed unique fun heavy champions.",leagueoflegends

Some interesting factoids from this

* Svenskeren and Niles share as the only players to have the fewest kills and most deaths in the same split. 
* Flaresz who holds the record with 90 deaths is the only player even in the ballpark of of Niles, with no other players passing 75 deaths in 18 games. 
* There are quite a lot of players with very good splits in the fewest kill category, Xmithie even has some All-Pro splits included. 
* Contracz and Xmithie with multiple appearances on the list. 
* Niles is the only non-support to average under 1 kill per game.

I don't think Niles is the worst player to ever play in the LCS. There are multiple other players with worst stats under a smaller sample size. What makes Niles so unique is that he was never benched and also never really improved either. You will quite often see players with very few kills start to play more aggressive near the end of the split, or vice versa for few deaths. Niles didn't really change much. I don't think bringing in Solo or another top laner would have saved GGS's split or Niles's career, but they certainly could have saved his dignity.

I loose my lane almost every game no matter how safe i play or aggressive i play. I learned all the champions and the only problem i seem to be having is how much more better they are at trading.

Once they win a trade its usually an all in or they can freeze the wave and i loose xp or risk my life getting ganked by their jg. Sometimes i can track their jg but then if i try to poke out the laner can gapclose and kill me.

So im forced to sit under my turret and hopefully farm myself but they poke hard or shove hard so i loose xp and gold either way. At this point im useless and i spend the rest of the game depressed as everyone else can play while i attempt to farm and go back into hiding.

I keep getting carried though by people like darius or vayne or some really good mid laner whos pretty much a god imo. Now im getting into games and i can barely touch farm without getting poked or dived. The teams are also much more coordinated.

Is there any way to go back to my actual skill level? I freeze up when things get to quick and its hard to think at all. Part of the reason i suck at trades but i know how to ward really well and time camps incase my jungle is ganking and its free gold to help me.

**It is Alphari, by a long shot. The man absolutely massacred everyone in every matchup. TL also looking very strong going into playoffs**

**-------**

**Background:** We see a lot of rankings based on differentials, but those have always bothered me a lot of the time. Players are playing losing champion matchups and then being attacked later (after people forget the matchups) for having a low CS differential or gold differential for the year. So I wanted to make a matchup-proof ranking.

To further elaborate, what this ranking is doing is looking at how, for example, a pro played Leblanc into Zoe and comparing against how every other mid or top laner pro player played that matchup. So if you score really high, that could mean every game this season you were down in CS, but what it would also mean, is that when other pros played that EXACT same matchup, they were even more down in CS. So if Chovy was down 15 cs in a matchup, that probably means on average, other pros were down somewhere between 20-30 cs in that same matchup, as an example, as Chovy has a good score.

So what is v3. v1 and v2 did a good job of accounting for laning statistics, those are obviously still included. But I have now focused on adding three more statistics/things: roaming/towers and game effectiveness. (1) Roaming/Towers looks at how often you were involved with first bloods outside of your lane and also your gold income outside of CS. If you roam and get a kill, what did it cost? I think people tend to forget about turret plates in pro play. And (2) game effectiveness, this looks at how much damage you are doing over the amount of gold you are getting as well as your ability to translate that into wins. (Please keep in mind these stats are also normalized against champion matchups) And (3) JUNGLERS NOW INCLUDED. (Also, I can do bot lanes, but it is a lot more work because of how champs work down there and I have not gotten to creating the code for that yet, sorry.)

I will do the LEC next week if people want to see it.

t3_m7j5cu,Tolerance toward being behind,"I see many players surrender early.

Many players have a really small threshold after which they stop tolerating being behind and just want to exit the game by surrendering.

However, many games are often winnable.

As patchs come your mental model about ""lost matchs"" can become obsolete.

If your mates want to continue and think it is winnable: Try to believe them instead of doubling down on your own believes. You may learn that your tolerance threshold for falling behind is off.

I believe it is good practice to once in a while recheck your tolerance level against others (or any odds) to raise your own bar and also to update your mental model about what's actually lost at what point and what is not.

t3_m73act,Writing Exercise: Alternative Skin Descriptions - Space Groove 2021,"One of my favorite days in the month since picking up League has been the day the new skins are revealed on PPE.

I'm following the basic rules. Try to characterize the skin/character as much as possible in a small space. And stick to 2 to 3 sentence (with some room for slight run-ons). I had fun doing this, so I might do it again.

01. Isolde
02. The Yordle
03. The Nontraditional Marksman
04. ?
05. ?

As we know, they will be 1 for each role and 1 bonus for the midlane because there are 2 types: melee assassin and mage.

JG is already taken by Viego;
Isolde is Top;
The Yordle is the midlane mage.

There are left the support champion, the adc and the melee assassin. What do you think about the Nontraditional Marksman:

- It will be the support just like Senna? (Also, it's a member of Sentinels of Lights too so it would make sense I guess).

- It will replace the ""melee"" assassin (I don't think so) from the midlane by the fact that it's a nontraditional carry so it will be played on a nontraditional position?

- It will be the actual adc? (Again: I don't think so)

- It will be a BONUS champion so we will have 7 total champions: Top (Isolde), JG (Viego), Mid Mage (Yordle), Mid Melee AD (?), ADC (?), Support (?) and the Nontraditional Marksman.

Its always someone flamming, afking, raging, tilted, purposely doing actions to make the team lose such as taking cs or refusing to help etc. Had my 1st game after months and i quit because of the toxicity and the afking rage quitters. Came back to try a game and i was just proven even right why this game isnt for me. I still dont understand why people play this game seriously (ranked). I only see this game being fun with friends where everyone just has fun and enjoys the game. All those years ive spent playing ranked and tilting off flammers and afkers, i wish i could get those years back lol. How else do you guys deal with the horrible people playing this game? Ye you can mute all but that ruins communications and even if you dont type you could still tilt someone because your laner TP gank or ganked after you pinged missing, they just rage and tilt off that. Majority of the people playing this game are so toxic, ive played many games and i can tell you League is the most toxic. I highly don't suggest playing this game seriously, play it for fun with friends because there are some kids online that you will want to punch in the face because of how childish and unhuman like they act, ive seen people wish cancer on others and family members wished upon to die, its absurd. Of course in real life these kids wont talk shit or say things like that because of the consequences, but online they have the screen as a shield lol.

Assuming they can communicate well enough with the team, they would never need wards, and no one on their team should ever die to ganks. Is that enough to offset the gigantic mechanical mismatch on an individual level? 

Also, another thought, but how would Riot react to someone like that? Banned from pro play even though they aren't 'technically' breaking any rules? Obviously it'd be an unfair advantage, but I'm not quite sure how you'd prove it, since they aren't actually modifying files.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know a lot of you are not stupid, but I need to state for the people who actually do not know better: I am talking to you 'Gold Elo' and lower, yes being in 'Gold Elo' means absolutely nothing.

\[Magic Damage\] will always use the \[Magic Resistance\] stat.

\[Physical Damage\] will always use the \[Defense\] stats.

No matter the 'Stat Ratio'-Stat Ratio

A. AD% = Total Attack Damage%  
B. bonus AD% = Total Damage - base Attack Damage  
C. **base** AD% = base Attack Damage without any items included.  
D. AP% = Total Ability Power (There is no base Ability Power...yet)  
E. Armor = Total Armor  
F. **bonus** Armor = Total Armor - **base** Armor  
G. **bonus** Magic Resist = Total Magic Resist - **base** Magic Resistance  


Note: There is not a single Ability or Item in the game that use \[**base** Armor\] or \[**base** Magic Resistance\] by themselves, in the whole game - Most of you are using 'Lethality' on a Champion that uses primarily \[Magic Damage\], knowing full well that the same exact Champion's \[Basic Attack\] does nothing.  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Epilogue:

I will not lie to you, I know I do not think about the game like the rest of you and that I do not play the game like the rest of you: I am the Type of person who actually uses every single stat on every Champion, and this includes 'Attack Damage' with 'Ability Power' 'Kai'Sa'.

I understand that 'Lethality' looks fun and cool, but you have to rely on one ability to do damage: However when you use 'Attack Damage' and 'Ability Power', you can literally use all your abilities which would all do more than you 'Lethality' \[Mystic Shot\].

I did not even add \[Nashor's Tooth\]  
[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Nashor's\_Tooth](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Nashor's_Tooth)  
to these calculations, which would add base damage and another 20% AP to \[Mystic Shot\].

I did not even add \[Muramana\]  
[https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Muramana](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Muramana)  
to these calculation, which would add base damage and then additional damage based on Max Mana.

Ezreal is actually fucking Disgusting: Remember that only one item made these ratios like this, You literally have five other item slots - all of which I use for Magic Penetration leaving me two slots, which I use for 'Muramana' and 'Rabadon's Deathcap' because it is actually fucking disgusting do the fact that 'Ability Power' Ratios already go over 100%: \[Rabadon's Deathcap\] simply multiplies that numerical that is mathematical over '1' by \[Rabadon's Deathcap (1.35) and that 'multiplicative' and in simple terms ""is very fast"": As a result I deal over 1,500 damage literally unless they have max resist which will result in me deal about 10% Maximum Health in the case of 'Cho'Gath' or 'Sion', of course this is at ""Full Build"", however let's be honest that the over all ratio's of damage dealt to the target's \[Maximum Health\] does not change much.

Ending Comments: The shit is actually disgusting, all you need to do actually survive long enough and it is game over and that only requires skill.",leagueoflegends

So basically I'm smurfing and trying to climb to my other account's rank, as I heard EUW players are better- that's why I'm in silver 3 in this game. anyway.

I had a jungler that won't gank but still finds a way to go 3/9

an adc that gives a free kill to your laner

a 1/7 morgana support flaming me

a feeding toplaner 

and me, 1/0/0 orianna stuck farming under turret because I can't outpush a lucian in the early game, down only 20 cs mind you pinging assist me every once in awhile, knowing full well this lucian is always pushed up and a free kill if anyone comes to help me. 

my jungler proceeds to: start drake while Lucian has mid prio and feed him a free kill. I never got a chance to do anything because I was stuck in lane hoping my team grows a brain. the miss fortune might look like they aren't inting but they gave a 200 gold shutdown to the lucian at lvl 6 after I backed. they just... level 4 miss fortune vs level 6 lucian what could go wrong? someone would probably say get good, but I could probably be an LEC player and still couldn't find a way to win this game because of the nature of mine and my opponent's champions... Orianna can go even with Lucian but cannot win, as I can poke thanks to my q's superior range, slowly poking him down and forcing him to base, the thing is that after he gets vamp scepter poking him down doesn't work anymore and I have to sit back and try to scale while not being able to push the wave out. the annoying thing about this game is that I didn't make a single mistake in lane, I nearly solokilled lucian and forced his teleport, after which he came back with a vamp scepter, tanked my poke and kept shoving the wave while trying to do something to me I'm not quite sure what... 

These kinds of match-ups aren't common but do exist in the game and I feel like Riot desperately needs to remove them, a player having no impact on a game because of the champion they picked instead of the way they played is a surefire way to lose your playerbase slowly, what's worse than losing? losing while knowing you didn't make a single mistake in the entire game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7uzgo,Bruisers &amp; Mages is the embodiment of what drives assassins off from mid lane,"Renekton &amp; Lissandra perfectly encapsulates the current game play philosophy of Riot: Renekton is manaless, has sustain (or has access to it through runes / items), his kit fixes his supposed problems (he is a melee champ and yet he gets huge range on his spammable Q, harassing the mid lane assassins due to his bruiser playstyle. Lissandra utilities mana, but has the ability to lock down champs with her R and W. With the broken Everfrost build, you can CC someone for 4-5 seconds which completely breaks the game. In addition to that, with her R and Zhonyas, it's impossible to do any damage to her without wasting all your abilities. 

Add all these stuff up and you get champs that bully out the mid assassins with their strong wave clear, and CC abilities plus stasis. And there is no way to all - in them without using all your abilities, but you lack the damage to finish the kill essentially eliminating the usefulness of assassins in the game. They just do too many things and too many abilities that hard counter or stat checks out the assassins in the mid lane, while both scale really really well.",leagueoflegends
t3_m72gs3,I would love an app like Path of building for League,"I was thinking the other day, wouldn't it be great to have an app similar to Path of building used in Path of Exile, for league of legends.

I mean you could pick a champ, runes, and then mess about with items builds to see what works vs another champ you can 'build' with the app.

Now I know you can do this (sort of) in the training tool, but that takes ages to load in each time you make a change to runes etc.
I want to see what a theoretical MF build would do to a level 13 Darius with a chosen set of items, Which you cant do in Training mode, you can't pick what the enemy bot builds and you can force them to level up and go non-hostile etc.

If we had a similar app like PoB that updates with League so damage numbers are current, I think this would be great to create builds quickly and know straight away if they work without, trolling teammates in a normal with a 'new build' that may look odd.",leagueoflegends

I can get solokill on him lvl 2, or even 2kills before lvl6. Then once he gets lvl6, if he hits an R, it's 100% death. Even if he misses, his QWE also easily takes 70% of my HP. And this is when he is behind. 

If he is slightly ahead, QE is a one shot.

If he is a bit fed, Q is a death (of course with W passive).

Like there is no way I can think of to beat this champion. But I know he isn't popular in proplay, so there should be some way to beat Fizz. However I am only interested in 1v1 scenarios, not ""calling jgl to roam"" ""team play"" etc, because that is not something you can count on in soloq.

Funny fact I'm actually a higher rank then them *being about a gold-plat player while they are typically silver and maybe low gold*. Still im just curious on some other people opinions.

t3_m7gsnu,Legacy Mastery,"Just had this thought a little while ago. With eternals, when a champion gets reworked, that champion receives 'legacy' eternals that are based on old metrics that the reworked champion cannot utilize, Volibear being a notable example of this. I think it would be pretty neat if they gated champion mastery in a similar fashion, because let's be real, reworks tend to share a vague general-ness with the previous champion and not much more. I think locking in a ""legacy mastery"" score at whatever amount each player had on that champion previously and perhaps providing a ""legacy mastery emote"" based on the unlocked mastery emote could help players feel like they participated in a piece of league history when they play the new version. This is purely anecdotal, but I think it would also help improve game satisfaction a small amount, as you no longer have to wonder if someone played the current or prior version of a champion for x amount of hours to get their mastery score, as the new champion would be starting fresh and the old stat would be retained for aesthetics. Maybe it's not the most feasible, but I know I'd appreciate something like this if one of my mains got reworked in the future.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7b1tq,I'm trying to enjoy LoL but matchmaking algorithm is making it difficult,"I am a fresh LoL player. Started 3 months ago for the first time. I am currently on level 35 and I really like the game but there's one thing I just need to rant about: matchmaking algorithm. As you might guess I am not yet extremely experienced, but at the same time I know I can be competent when playing against people on my level of experience. However, I keep being matched against people who are significantly more experienced than me and against whom I stand zero chances of winning. It is common for me to have the opposing players in my lane be 200 levels higher then me and supp. (I know levels might not be an accurate measurement of skill but someone who has level 250 or so must have been playing this game for years.) In Draft mode overwhelming majority of games I play are completely imbalanced: average level in the opposing team often being 40 levels higher, or highest level in my team being lower than lowest level in opposing team.

I decided to give ranked games a try. I figured that if I'm assigned to a league I'll end up playing people of my skill level but that didn't work at all and the matches seem even more imbalanced than in draft. I got assigned to ""Brown I"" despite loosing most placement matches and recently I had a ranked match where three players from opposing team were from Silver leagues III and IV (needless to say, we didn't stand a chance). This feels really frustrating. At the moment I can safely say that one out of five matches I play are evenly matched. It doesn't necessarily mean that my team wins such matches, but it means that even if we lose I get a feeling that we could have won if we did just slightly better. I was kinda hoping that after losing so much I'll be degraded to a lower league and matches will become better but that doesn't seem to be happening. In fact, I seem to be gaining rank after winning matches because someone else on the team carried, despite my poor performance (e.g. KDA 0/7/2).

All in all, in terms of matchmaking LoL is a horrible experience for me. I used to play Starcraft II on a completely amateur level (Silver league) and overwhelming majority of games were evenly matched. Is there anything I can actually do to have more evenly matched games?",leagueoflegends

t3_m7m9gs,Mythic Items Passives Heavily Unbalanced Compared to Eachother,"Max values all assuming standard builds (1 Mythic, 1 Boot, 4 Legendarys)  
\*= About/Around  
Immortal shieldbow, 50 hp 5 ad, ,max 200 hp 20 ad  
530 gold for hp, 700 gold for ad ( 50 HP around 133 gold, 10 AD 350 gold)  
1200\* gold value

Everfrost, 15 ap per legendary, max 60 ap, thats a large rod  
(1250 gold) or 3 amp tomes(1300\*gold).   


5 Ability Haste passives( Lynadris, Dark Harvast etc)  
Gold Value around 100-130 gold per 5 Ability haste  
Max 20 ability haste, Gold value 400-500 gold  
Diminishing effect with more ability haste aka worse gold value

(Long Explanation of how I came with the gold value)  
5 ability haste is actually a joke of value. Kindlegem is 800 gold for 200 hp and 10 ah. 150 hp is worth 400 gold so the added 50 hp is about 130 gold. Meaning the added 10 ah is worth around 270. Look at Ionian boots, 900 gold 45 ms 20 ah and summoner haste. Assuming the 12 summoner haste is an added bonus, the 45 mv is around 500 gold and the 20 ah is 400 gold, meaning every 5 ah is 100 gold. 130 gold bonus is a joke, with a max build your getting around 500 gold worth of extra stats (4 legendary, 1 boot, 1 mythic). Especially when you consider the more ability haste you have the lower its value actually becomes.

 3% movement speed (galeforce/stridebreaker)  
Max 12% movement speed, 340 base for example, 385 with boots  
10.2=3%, 11.55=3% with boots  
120-130 gold value per 3%  
Max 12%=550\*Gold  
(Explanation on how I came to the value)  
3% movement speed on a character with base 340 mv is 10.2.  
max build you would receive 40.8 movement speed  
with tier 2 boots of 45 mv, you would get 11.55 (46 movement speed max build)  
46 movement speed is just tier 2 boots   
considering that 25 mv is 300 gold, 46 would equal around 550 gold  
One can argue that movement speed is a broken stat on every champion but based on the gold values, its underwhelming

Clearly the mythic passives are unbalanced when comparing them can lead to a 2/1 value difference as seen from Immortal shieldbow and Everfrost compared to Galdeforce/Stridebreaker and all the 5 Ability Haste Mythics.  
Riot needs to buff the passives for many items to at least make them all around 1000 gold value max build, or they can nerf the high-value mythic passives like Shieldbow and Everfrost  
But it might lead to champions simply not building Mythics every game, which seems to be against what Mythics were intended to be.",leagueoflegends

t3_m6k1xc,The Space Groove Sound Design is PHENOMENAL,"Seriously, they hit it out of the park with the disco theme. 


If you've got a PBE account, I strongly recommend going into the practice tool, cranking up the volume and just listening to these skins after spamming some abilities. These are some of the best sound-gameplay work that Riot's ever designed, even getting close to DJ Sona levels of awesome. They're just DRIPPING with retro-futuristic goodness.



Nasus in particular is REALLY cool. His Q has a few different sound effects, different disco-sounding chord hits. What's interesting though is that using his Ult starts this little drum loop that runs during its whole duration, and his E has a funky bassline while its active. All of this APPEARS to be synced to each other, so you start the all in Nasus-R-E, and then start doing funky-freestyling on the Q bonks. It's GREAT.  



Samira is also super-sweet. Her style passive has these rising string-brass hits that get higher as she gains style points. While that's pretty sick, if you chain them all together in her combo, they form a sort of jazz-funk lick that sounds STRAIGHT out of an Earth Wind and Fire track. That gets topped off with the music that plays during her ult, which is now a holographic 60's roller disco montage. 



Every single recall and dance theme is crazy-funky. I don't know who they got to write all the disco music, or if it was done in-house, but it's gorgeous, it's gaudy, and it's DISCO. The sfx on this skinline are GREAT, I hope we get more of these in the coming years.",leagueoflegends

t3_m7co0s,The guide to Smack Talk,"First I want to give you a few reasons why smack Talk is not to be overlooked and can be very funny and helpful. 

If done without the intention to harm someone or verbally abuse them or harrase others it can be a good way to release some Stress, verbally poke the enemy's team in a competitive way, having a propaly funny game if the enemy team is smack talking back at you the right way. 

Smack talk should always be related to the game only with the intention to provoke the enemy a little bit. In order to do so, finding some flaws, adding some stupid-funny line to it and not overdoing it a smack is created. Think of it as a meme. The meme can be working or not. If it works build on it and create new content but if not drop it. 
So what could be a good smack? Saying something about a missed ultimate, by also adding something about yourself. 

Example: that ulti just hit the my champ in the  game I played before. 

Might not be a good line but it's clear. It's not mean and also not agressive. 

What's bad smack talk? 

Well bad smack talk is the opposite of good smack talk and on the verge of verbally abuse or spamming. 

As example, telling someone over and over again that he missed a skill shot without anything added is not good smack Talk. 

Or telling someone how bad he/she is without adding at least somewhat funny or good lines is bad smack talk. 

What to do if I get harresed or the seemingly smack talk of the enemy evolved into harrasment? 

It's simple. Either you mute them or you use their energy against them by being very very positive. Smiley like this: :D, xD, :P are mostly enough to get enemy's, if they are flamming you, tilted. Also just laughing everything off. Not giving anything and always ignore long texting. Just emotes and laughs are enough and will prevented you from getting distracted by them.  The chat can be a powerful tool if  you know Which risks it's brings.

 Lol is a toxic community. It also means that many already are Titled and flame everyone. Instead of swallowing their shit just let this energy boing flip back to them or mute them. That's the way to stay healthy and getting something out of games with strong flame and rage. 

 If you could think of more or something I might have forgotten just add it.",leagueoflegends

All Yorick players want is a fair buff, he's been waiting long enough for one. Possibly a mini rework of some kind to give the Yorick player more agency and make him less oppressive in Bronze and Iron, which are the only elos he has a high winrate in.

I understand when a person sells items at the end of the game, but for sure Riot can check when they sold items and how long the game continued for after that.   


That is one of the most often used forms of troll and it not being cracked down feels shitty for all players, since the feeling of someone trolling getting left unpunished kills the drive to play.",leagueoflegends

t3_m62guj,"For what it’s worth: Here is LS addressing ‘The Renekton Question’ on stream, during the last day of LCS, hours before the ’99% of takes are wrong’ thread appeared.","Forewarning: No this is not a short clip. You’ll have to watch the twitch vod. His answer begins at 1:42:46, and ends at around 1:57:00 (so about 14 minutes long).  
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/949521207?t=1h42m46s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/949521207?t=1h42m46s)  


TL;DW (Here’s my translation job, enjoy).  


\- LS is not planning on having ‘The Renekton Talk’ with Caedral, because he feels that there is not an adequate way to engage with the question (too lengthy, hard to pin down to ‘an answer’, spawns a lot of toxicity no matter the response, etc).  


\- LS cites a reddit thread that goes into why purely using ‘winrate’ as a measure of the effectiveness of a champion like Renekton, is not very useful information. Statistics is complicated.  
Thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/iq51dc/is\_renekton\_op\_the\_winrate\_paradox/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/iq51dc/is_renekton_op_the_winrate_paradox/)\-  


 LS cites a parallel to the ‘Renekton has a high play+win rate’ assertion: “Every pro in the world is building Morellonomicon. Every pro in every region is building it. It is built X amount of times. It can’t possibly be better than Liandry’s’.  


 \- LS dislikes the fact that the question begins by asking him to ‘explain more about Renekton’, despite the time he has spent addressing the question in past content.  


\- LS typically answers of lot of this style of question in private, with pros etc. , and (indirectly) alludes to an uneasiness with the fact that Caedral’s question was ‘asked’ publicly on twitter.  


\- LS believes that to answer this type of question requires a lot of groundwork, and can be aided by skillsets not easily obtained in a MOBA game alone.  


\- LS cites a conversation he had with Wicked (about Smash Bros Melee) about how newly discovered information in a game can lead to a change in perception about a meta, matchup etc., without the game itself changing. He also cites Urgot’s recent appearance in the meta as an example of this.  


\- LS cites that in international play (Worlds/MSI), over the course of long tournaments, picks tend to generally trend toward scaling (whilst champs like Renekton ‘slowly fade out over the course of the tournament’). This is backed up by interviews with pro players over the course of said tournaments, e.g. Perkz on why picking early-game champs vs FPX contributed to their loss.  


\- LS asserts that playing Renekton is like ‘riding a bike with training wheels’. It will help a good team beat a worse team + pick up wins, but will hurt them long term. Conversely, Renekton will not help a worse team beat a better team.   


\- LS cites ‘deviation’ i.e. ‘the stats on pick/WR of a champion across regions and how this differs’ (alluding to the fact that it’s difficult to discern things from statistics alone). He also says that Max will at some point release a google doc/sheet alluding to this.  


\- LS cites reasons for supporting Renekton as: ""complacency, laziness, and a refusal to analyse what’s happening (in Renekton games), break down what’s happening, and create-new.""  


\- LS concludes due to the amount of time he’s already spent on the question, and the amount of time still required to answer the question (potentially a multi-hour conversation), that it’s better to not engage. 

Edit: For those late to the party, here is ‘the Renekton Question’.

Another champion who could last a long time is Sona because she is a cute girl, sells a lot of skins and is somewhat fair to play against, and by that I mean, she kinda sucks as a support if you are any competent at the game.

A third champion I feel could last a long time without any balance changes is Ahri because she is a cute girl, sells a lot of skins and is somewhat fair to play against, although she is one of those champions whose effectiveness scales directly with how good you are at playing Ahri, and not with how bad your opponents are at playing League of Legends.

I can see the evil/opposing champs of the SG champs on the next patch. Lissandra is heavly quoted on the new SG champ bios so, Space Groove Lissandra confirmed?

In the bio, they also hinted the 3 Party Goddesses, so maybe 1 of them is Isolde? Maybe they're the ones in the teaser image that we got months ago too. Hoping for Orianna lol

But just take this with a grain of salt cause maybe they'll reveal her tomorrow or friday like Viego(but Viego is a special case cause of the league roadblock last January)

t3_m6t9ut,Chinese Rumors for LDL Suspension: Matchfixing from SJG,"Original Source: https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10325204

**Note: This is more or less me interpreting the Google Translate article. It's possible that I've misinterpreted the information provided. It's also a developing situation, so the source itself may not be 100% accurate. It's pretty damning news though, so I figure I would mention it on Reddit for those following this.**

Also thanks to /u/DJJohnnymeister, since he updated his previous post on the issue, I went looking for the source and though it would be worth bring to Reddit.

LDL was suspended yesterday. While the [english tweet](https://twitter.com/lplenglish/status/1371660640352227334?s=20) didn't specify why, it's while believed this is due to match fixing, particularly with the LDL team [Sheng Jie Gaming](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Sheng_Jie_Gaming). They happened to forfeit two matches in Week 6 and 7, and it's thought that this was due to the match fixing allegations.

According to Chinese streamer SilenceOB, the primary instigator of this is former ESY top laner Spunk, who before joining ESY was a member of the WE development program. According to SJG's manager, Spunk felt like the team was going to lose again [Kaisa Gaming](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Kaisa_Gaming) (KSG), and placed a bet against his own team to lose. Somehow, they managed to win the series [2-1](https://lpl.qq.com/es/stats.shtml?bmid=7100) (lol), meaning Spunk lost bunch of money in the deal. As a follow up, to recoup the money, he placed another bet and got the coordination of his teammates. This was discovered by the management/owner, which led to the team forfeiting games while they looked for replacement players. 

SilenceOB believes that the ownership of SJG was not aware/did not participate in the thrown games, as the forfeiting of the matches afterwards was done by the management afterwards, and it wouldn't make sense that they would do something like that if they were in on the fix.

There are a lot of rumors about how a 10 man roster (which SJG had by the end of this ordeal) could forfeit, how the entire team+management is complicit and that all LDL matches are rigged, but SilenceOB doesn't believe that's the case. He's advocating for transparency in this investigation to get to the bottom of this situation and help get the truth from this situation. Additionally, for clubs/players who have played by the rules, this is very unfair to them as they now need to suspend their careers due to these shenanigans.

That pretty much covers the article so the following is just speculation on my part:
SJG did play another match against ESY before they forfeited against JDM where Spunk played, and it's worth noting he was pretty negative gaming in that [series](https://lpl.qq.com/es/stats.shtml?bmid=7110), going 0/7/3 and 0/3/0 respectively. After that match, Spunk and ADC ch1rry were no longer starters after they came back against LNG, replaced by Lilac (one of their mid laners) and fuyao (the backup ADC) respectively. In my mind (and remember, this is just based off of what I know and could be wrong), it seems like this confirms the allegations for Spunk, and makes ch1rry look suspect (although his ESY series wasn't as bad as Spunk). 

It also casts a bad light on ESY, as between Spunk (their former top laner) and Bo (their former jungler) both being on the hook for match fixing, that squad is looking pretty suspect and will likely be investigated.",leagueoflegends
t3_m75sw4,Call me crazy but the ratio of Stun / Mobility / Survivability / Damage should be kept relatively even.,"To elaborate what i mean. 

Imo to keep the game balance somewhat fair (Which it isn't clearly) Mobility CC Damage and Survivability - imagine a diagram if you had 25% of each it would mean 100% in total with equal distribution. Or to make champs differ you would just ""shift"" these percentages in favor where the total is still 100% to prevent Powercreeps.


Now you will or might say that mobility and survivability can't be compared statistically, well. It's easy to see the outcome though. If you're as tanky as let's say, Maokai, with the mobility of lets say Irelia. There has to be something she should be terrible at. Which isn't the case. She might be harder, but objectively speaking Irelia is a better champ than someone like Xerath. Because she has more damage over time, pretty much the same burst if not more, sustain, same CC but potentially better because it's aoe, she is faster and more mobile, and hell even her core items are better.


Why? Well the only thing he has for an advantage really is his Range. Which is also offset by her superior mobility to a degree. 

So mobility is already worth more than raw Survivability because it adds additional options or utility to make up for something.


Same with CC, you don't have to deal the same amount of damage to win against someone with CC. The problem shows when the character WITH CC deals more damage than the one without. Example? Well, if we keep the roles the same to make it fair, try to win as Gangplank vs Irelia. At any stage of the game, yes you might say they have different ""goals"" in a teamfight because GP is AOE, but does that justify being worse at early game where AOE isn't relevant at all for example? It doesn't seem clear to me why he has to be painfully predictable and weak at the same time in the early game. He still needs lvl 13 to be at his ""best"" kit wise but the game got much faster. Kayle got a buff to compensate for this and they swapped lvl 16 and lvl 11 passive upgrade. 




I don't know it seems there is a huge disconnect between balancing utility and numbers.

Why is gangplank for example not allowed to scale faster than someone that has an overall better lategame than him while being worse early with less utility? It doesn't make sense to me in the slightest.

He is a good example because he is one of the most obvious champs that scale abnormally huge with items in comparison to what he starts with. But never enough to make enemies actually try and stop his scaling. It just takes too long in general. 

If i could play Yasuo or Irelia, why would i ever play Gangplank? Other than my champion preference.


Viktor for example has it all, Mobility to a degree, especially with phase rush, damage, potential CC, and survivability. 

That's why he seems to never be ""useless"" like other champs that don't have any of those AT ALL.

t3_m6qafm,Who's the beatdown? League of Legends / Renekton edition,"**Who's the beatdown?**

This is an trading card game (TCG) strategy question answered in a [1999 article ](https://articles.starcitygames.com/1999/01/01/whos-the-beatdown/). League is similar to a TCG, especially in a drafting sense. Each champion has strengths and weaknesses, just like cards do. I think everyone who drafts at a pro level should understand these concepts.

Understanding the main points of the article are a huge help to any strategy game. The article goes into MTG specifics, which you can try to understand, but are not relevant at all to the primary points. People often analyze their gameplay, be it in league or card games, and come to the wrong conclusion. 

I played a ton of yugioh for years travelling to tournaments and heard this many times, ""I played that game perfectly, I just got unlucky and lost."" While that possibility exists because it is a card game, these people never take a step further and think that if they played perfectly and did not win, perhaps their deck was the problem. Or their champion choice. You can play Kayle vs Irelia perfectly and probably never win as Kayle. The problem is likely not your gameplay, it is the champion choice. 

In every MTG game, each player can be assigned a role. There will be one beatdown and one control. One deck that tries to kill the other and one that tries to survive. Here is a quote from the article that encompasses the main points. 

&gt;In similar deck vs. similar deck matchups, there are a couple of things that you want to look at to figure out what role to play:

&gt;1. Who has more damage? Usually he has to be the beatdown deck.
&gt;2. Who has more removal? Usually he has to be the control deck.
&gt;3. Who has more permission and card drawing? Almost always he has to be the control deck.

&gt;If you are the beatdown deck, you have to kill your opponent faster than he can kill you. If you are the control deck, you have to weather the early beatdown and get into a position where you can gain card advantage.

Some examples to help you understand from various games if you have played others, and from league:

Game| Beatdown| Control
---|---|----|----
Yugioh | Gouki | Sky Striker
Hearthstone | Zoo Warlock | Reno Priest
MTG | Mono red | Mono blue
Starcraft | Zerg | ? (idk Starcraft)
LoL | Zed | Viktor
LoL | Olaf | Kindred

**Beatdown**

The beatdown often has a strong early game, which leads to snowballs and running away with the game. The beatdown can also obliterate some matchups, a good example would probably be irelia vs kayle. Irelia absolutely destroys Kayle and unless the Kayle can somehow survive, the game is doomed for her until 2-3 items probably. 

The beatdown will have less of a chance of winning the longer the game goes on. The control will get more value through card advantage, scaling, usefulness in teamfighting, etc. If there is a 2v2 with jungle + mid for crab at three minutes, would you rather have Olaf + Pantheon or Kindred + Viktor? Olaf + Panth should slaughter that fight. Does the answer change at 10 min? 20? 30? There should come a point where Olaf + Panth has been outscaled. 

The beatdown is under pressure to gain an advantage early. Kayle vs Irelia at 10 minutes tied at 0/0/0 with 80 farm each is a massive win for Kayle. Irelia cannot let Kayle free farm. This is true in any matchup of course, but the beatdown is pressured to do it more than the control would. Kayle can let Irelia free farm and eventually be more useful. 

Dragon control is also something that the beatdown will have early. Junglers like Sett and Olaf are often the beatdown and can solo dragons early. Third dragon is sometimes when the control comp comes online and can try to contest. 

**Control**

The control often has a weaker early game, although does not have to. The control looks to outscale over time, and given infinite time, will win almost every game. Control mages, aptly named, are great examples on league that everyone probably understands. Who will have more impact on a teamfight at 30 minutes, Anivia or Zed? The mage with the ability to put down a wall, a multi man stun, a multi man slow, or the assassin who has the opportunity to one shot someone? If the one shot works, Zed might be able to have more impact. But by thirty minutes there could be Zhonyas, GA, etc. 

You could argue that the control is under pressure to not die early or fall too far behind, but I would counter that the control does not have to be some useless early game champ like Kayle. It can be Orianna vs Zed where the matchup is not a disaster. The pressure on the control is considerably less. 

Control comps often give up the first two, sometimes even three, dragons until they are strong enough to fight. 

**Renekton**

That is probably enough examples about other games, lets get into the current discussion. Renekton. With our prior knowledge of Renekton and what I just described about beatdown vs control, I hope it is clear that Renekton is a champion that normally takes the role of the beatdown. We know he is strong early and is often called a lane bully. 

Does being a beatdown champion alone make Renekton bad? No. Beatdown champions CAN be good. There are likely some matchups between two beatdown champions where Renekton takes the role of the control. But you have to understand that you are putting yourself, or your players, under additional pressure to gain an early advantage and the longer the game goes on, the lower your win chances will be. The team comp as a whole with Renekton will often be more likely to be the beatdown. Renekton is going to go in. He is going to try to kill the other champions. He does not offer zone control, peeling, mass cc, scaling, etc. 

Here is one example of Renekton in pro play. The table below is in pick order. 

VIT | S04
---|---|----
Renekton | Thresh
Nidalee | Lillia
Kaisa | Aphelios
Jayce | Gangplank 
Nautilus | Syndra

This is from 2021 LEC Spring, Week 1 Day 1. 

B1 - Renekton. VIT is already saying that they want the role of the beatdown here before any information is shown.

R2/3 -Thresh + Lillia. S04 replies relatively well. Thresh and Lillia vs Renekton are both control vs Renekton.

B2/3 - Nidalee + Kaisa. VIT continues picking beatdown type champions. Nidalee is intentionally picked as the beatdown into Lillia, who is already trying to be the control. 

I am not going to go through all of the picks here because it is clear what is happening. VIT goes all beatdown vs all control from S04. What do we expect to happen? S04 will win unless VIT gets a large enough lead to end the game early before S04 can scale. 

At thirty minutes, there are five kills total in the game. VIT has three dragons with their early lead, S04 has one. The lead does not seem to have been bigger than 3-4k gold so far. Renekton is 0/0/0. S04 wins the thirty minutes dragon fight 2-0 and takes the dragon. They go on to get soul. The game lasts about 48 minutes and ends with S04 killing the nexus. Renekton is 2/0/0 in 48 minutes. 

Was Renekton the only problem? No. I would venture to say that VIT's entire draft was the issue. But it started with Renekton and shows a clear lack of understanding of control vs beatdown as they intentionally opted into the beatdown role. Renekton did not gain the lead he needed to run away with the game. He failed at his role as the beatdown and should be unfavored to win when we take a snapshot at 30 minutes. 

Picking Renekton often makes your team assume a beatdown role. Or if you try to pair Renekton with other champions that scale he will be trying to fight when they are not ready. VIT could have pivoted into a control role with their B2-5, but B1 Renekton already locked them into a beatdown role. 

**TLDR + Closing thoughts**

I hope I did not ramble too much and helped you guys learn something. 

TLDR - 

There are two roles champions/teams/decks can assume: beatdown and control. Beatdown tries to kill the control, control tries to survive and outscale. Control will win given infinite time. 

You should avoid putting yourself in a beatdown role because it puts you under pressure to get a lead, while your opponents will be able to chill and outscale you if you fail to get a lead. 

Renekton is a beatdown champion usually, meaning he has to try to get leads early. When he is against a control champion, like Ornn, Gangplank, Gragas, Sion, Chogath, Camille, etc., he will get outscaled. Renekton is only able to be useful if he gets leads against these type of champions, and he will still be less useful than them as the game goes on. Think about what Renekton brings to a teamfight at thirty minutes vs any of Ornn, Gangplank, Gragas, Sion, Chogath, and Camille. Even if Renekton is 5/0, he still does not have the utility that many of them do. If Renekton is not fed at this point, he cannot hope to be better.",leagueoflegends
t3_m7i81b,Noob champ Tristana isn't balanced,"I can't understand how this champion didn't get a single nerf this patch.  Noob champs like Tristana shouldn't be pickable in multiple roles.  Tristana doesn't have a single skill shot, scales better than any melee champ, while also being a lane bully, with a free escape, that also buffers CC so I can't gank her.

I've seen a Tristana beat Talon level 2 in an all in.  So I have to ask why is one of the best scaling champions in the game also allowed to be the best early game assassin, oh and she can also do this without needing to land a single skill shot, since all her abilities are ranged point and click.  Even if I gank she just kills my mid laner then uses the reset to jump away.

I hate this new burst meta and wish we could move toward more strategic counter-play like used to exist back in season 9 and earlier.  Why can't we push more high skill champs like Yasuo, instead of his noob friendly brother Yone.  Push Kayn instead of stat check Mundo, Hecarim or whichever flavor of the month Chemtank abuser.

The new items have some really cool actives and very cool concepts, I just wish they'd tone down the amount of raw stats so people wouldn't die in 0.5 seconds.  Do people actually think this is fun? Maybe it's just me, but I really am not enjoying season 11 even the start of the season when Kayn was OP, it just wasn't fun.

Biggest thing for me is hyperscaling late game carries like Tristana, Kassadin, Kayle, and plenty of others have far too much power in the early game.  Even Vayne feels like she comes online way too early ever since Kraken Slayer was made.",leagueoflegends

t3_m73m1g,Beginner Questions,"So I got started with LoL 2 days ago and so far it's a pretty fun Moba. I've Been trying out a few different Mobas recently. I've played Dota 2 for 6 years and have played Smite for a few months now. So needless to say I have some Moba experience under my belt. My first question is why is smite locked behind level 9? It makes jungling impossible for the first few matches. I know you guys will say to do bot matches but I just want to start learning the game with real players since I have moba experience. It makes the first couple of games really weird because you'll have either a 2v2 top if everyone is a noob or a 2v1 top and a smurf in the jungle free farming. I would think they would let you get used to one of the most important roles while everyone is bad but nope (tried jungling without smite and it was a disaster). Another thing I'm not sure about is why can't I look at other characters abilities by clicking on them? In Smite it makes sense as to why you cant since its 3rd person, but in dota you can click on an enemy and read their abilities. Half the time I feel like I have to go suicide just to get a feel for the other characters kit. It's kinda hard to look up what every character does mid game and I suck at remembering abilities just from reading them out of game since there are over 100 characters. It's gonna take a while to learn what everyone does and I get that but I find it unintutive. The new player experience could improve like most other mobas but so far it's fun.",leagueoflegends

&amp;#x200B;

I've personnally never experienced this, because I am a challenger level jungler. But if I did, I would go on the lol wiki and look into the numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

The drakes all have a similar amount of HP, so I take the tankiest (most armor), the Mountain drake.

*  4090HP, 41 armor
* Jinx ult minimum dmg:  25 (+ 15% **bonus** AD) (+ 25% of target's **missing** health) 
   * not mitigated on monsters
* Assuming you hit the drake 
   * point blank range
   * at around 700hp
   * have no bonus ad
      * You deal **873** dmg pre armor mitigation
      * That is **618** dmg after calculating in armor
* If we assume this is around lvl6
   * Smite deals 480-540 dmg depending on the jungler's level

Now then. If the Jinx has even a tiny amount of brain she will try to idk... buy ad, or not shoot point blank at which point the damage only increases.

t3_m7c2zv,How to do Smack Talk in LoL the right way and how to react to bad smack talk,"First I want to give you a few reasons why smack Talk is not to be overlooked and can be very funny and helpful. 

If done without the intention to harm someone or verbally abuse them or harrase others it can be a good way to release some Stress, verbally poke the enemy's team in a competitive way, having a propaly funny game if the enemy team is smack talking back at you the right way. 

Smack talk should always be related to the game only with the intention to provoke the enemy a little bit. In order to do so, finding some flaws, adding some stupid-funny line to it and not overdoing it a smack is created. Think of it as a meme. The meme can be working or not. If it works build on it and create new content but if not drop it. 
So what could be a good smack? Saying something about a missed ultimate, by also adding something about yourself. 

Example: that ulti just hit the my champ in the  game I played before. 

Might not be a good line but it's clear. It's not mean and also not agressive. 

What's bad smack talk? 

Well bad smack talk is the opposite of good smack talk and on the verge of verbally abuse or spamming. 

As example, telling someone over and over again that he missed a skill shot without anything added is not good smack Talk. 

Or telling someone how bad he/she is without adding at least somewhat funny or good lines is bad smack talk. 

What to do if I get harresed or the seemingly smack talk of the enemy evolved into harrasment? 

It's simple. Either you mute them or you use their energy against them by being very very positive. Smiley like this: :D, xD, :P are mostly enough to get enemy's, if they are flamming you, tilted. Also just laughing everything off. Not giving anything and always ignore long texting. Just emotes and laughs are enough and will prevented you from getting distracted by them.  The chat can be a powerful tool if  you know Which risks it's brings.

 Lol is a toxic community. It also means that many already are Titled and flame everyone. Instead of swallowing their shit just let this energy boing flip back to them or mute them. That's the way to stay healthy and getting something out of games with strong flame and rage.

t3_m70try,Display bug on new liandry?," 

Hello, new liandry has a new passive that does bonus damage depending on target bonus health, up to 12%.

I did 23 000 damage on this game, and my liandry damage amp did 5300.

This is mathematically impossible because even if I would benefit from the 12% extra damage constantly I would do 2760 damage (12% of 23000) which would be already very strange because you can't benefit from the passive against squishies or before the liandry is finished. In fact the amp did almost 25% of my total damage. Wtf ? Is that a display bug or a double dip somewhere? Will I get banned for bug exploit?

Just now I did another game where my amp did 2500 but my total damage done was only 8500, and there was no tank in the enemy team (just some bonus health items on supp and top), it is even more impossible. If the passive was working as intented I would estimate the damage on that game around 300/400, probably even less because i was fighting mostly people that had 0 bonus health.

I thought PBE was meant to test such things. Does anyone have explanation?

t3_m5yea9,Irelia reached a point where she can ignore macro and go full micro,"Playing toplane against Irelia, especially good Irelias (dia+), became such a pain in the last months that I dont even know how she dodges nerfs anymore.

The big problem for me is her passive, which gives her way too high stats, especially in early game.

At lv 1 you already get about 1,2k gold  as pure stats from the atks and onhit dmg.

How is this considered to be okay?

As soon as Irelia is about to get even close to 5 passive stacks in early, you have to hug your tower. Every trade with her is a deathsentence, regardless of which champ you play.

When I setup a slowpush, she just Qs through my casters and runs me down with 5 stacks.

When I try to freeze, she just just instantly runs me down cause she most likely alrdy stacker her passive.

Is there any other option to just let the waves run into the tower? - And what do you do when she freezes you?

Feel free to give me some advices.

&amp;#x200B;

(Obviously, these standings do not completely represent which teams are stronger than the other, but it is a start).

And if I use the standings as a determination for which team is better than over the course of LCS regular split, Renekton has only ever managed to take 3 wins over \*arguably\* better teams (TSM vs C9; Liquid vs C9; 100T vs Liquid).

The rest of the chart is mostly dominated by stronger teams beating weaker teams, and having Renekton on their team while they do it.

Obviously, League of Legends is infinitely more complicated than that, this completely ignores team compositions, which players are better, and many will argue which team is better than the other (you can test this theory by making your own team power ranking and see whether Renekton helped create more upsets).

This observation was purely to check two things:

1. whether stronger teams boost Renekton's win rate
2. If Renekton is a strong champ, did he help create upsets for weaker teams.",leagueoflegends

the biggest issue is that it goes away when entering combat. this is very clunky and problematic because again it goes away for 0.5 second and when you stop it builds up over 2.5 seconds, am really not sure which genius thought this would feel nice to play because it doesn't. its incredibly clunky, just let him keep the movement speed this makes him disproportionally weak vs ranged cc and damage and it just feels annoying for the thing to just give you ms then stop then give you ms then stop every second. just let him have maybe reduced MS in combat or something, or maybe reduced MS when he himself actually gets in melee range and does damage.

it just feels like ass to play warwick because of it. I was chasing a vlad earlier, the vlad was behind as hell and could never 1v1 me, even tho he had 10% hp. he kept spamming his E while am chasing him and I could never get to him because W turns off and am stuck with one of the worst base moveement speeds in the game for a melee champion. it just doesn't make any sense why it works this way

t3_m7841c,"I'm sorry, but how is riot claiming their system is good? (matchmaking)","The matchmaking is so clueless of what it's doing, I'm surprised it's still working properly for some people.

Matchmaking sets you with and against players ""equally skilled"" or more accurately ""have similar mmr"".

I know that team games that only count in lossees and wins and not player's performance isn't really a great system....

But let's get real here..

Last game, I had a player whose rank was Gold 4, this player was playing Illaoi top, he was claiming that he was bad top and wanted mid.

Anyway, he was playing against Nautilus top and let's just say, I want to forget that game so I don't remember exactly, but I believe he had max 1 kill, and more than 8 deaths..

This is not adressing individuals, this is questioning, how can Gold 4 lose to Nautilus top as Illaoi?

Let alone, how is Illaoi that can't beat Nautilus top gold rank in the first place?

It almost seems like the only hard part about recieving Victorious skin isn't the rank, but rather having a honor above level 2, which is sometimes pretty hard in this game filled with toxicity...

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all of this, riot claims that their matchmaking system is perfect and when you mention people like this they just hide behind curtains of: ""well it was just a bad matchup"" ""the player was tilted"" ""the player had a bad game""

And saying like, ""system can't predict players behaviour"", ofc it can't because the only value of data it gets it's wins and losses, and their preffered roles.

If the system could notice that a player is for example a trash jungler, and loses alot when they play jungler instead other roles, the system could be a lot smarter with this information if it knew what it had to do with it, like at least the only thing it could do, is not giving this player a jungler role...

t3_m6n713,Useful Volibear facts :),"**Number 1:**

Neither his Q nor his W draw Minion Aggro, despite both of them being single target spells. One of which is even an empowered auto attack. Is this intended? Probably not, but it's been in the game for such a long time that I'm not even sure anymore. 

This means his regular E-Q-W-AA or E-Q-AA-W combo is super efficient in lane because you only start tanking creeps after at your second or third hit, and a lot of that creep damage will then get eaten up by the shield you get from your E. If you want, you can bypass the auto attack and just do Q-W and you'll be completely safe from minion aggro.

---

**Number 2:**

Despite being pretty much full melee, Volibear is amazing at harrassing opponents who are trying to farm under tower. Why? Because you can just hardshove the wave with your passive and then E-Q-W-AA them off cooldown. A lot of the damage you'd take from the tower will get eaten up by the Shield, and once you get your target to around 40% or 50% HP, you can usually dive them with R and kill them off.

And what if they hit you back? You'll probably heal it back up by just using W off cooldown. They obviously won't let you do this every time, but you can reliably do this during dives and early game all ins.

---

**Number 3:**

You can somewhat buffer R during the Q animation. This seems like a weird thing to know and you might even call it useless information. However, this is important for one thing alone. This makes it so Q-R is guaranteed on targets with no Tenacity, as Q stuns them for 1 second and the R has a 1 second delay, so the fact that you can buffer an ability during the other pretty much takes the Human Error out of the equation.

Opponents who spec into either Merc Treads, or bring Legend Tenacity or Unflching can however either flash, or use an invulnerability spell/active.

---

**Number 4:**

Volibear is extremely snowbally. If you get a single early kill, chances are you can just run down the enemy laner over and over and over again and completely deny them of not just gold but also XP. 

That being said, playing with confidence is extremely important as Volibear, otherwise you'll just get shoved and fall behind, and falling behind is a big no no as Volibear, as Voli really struggles to close out games that are somewhat even in gold.

However, it is also important to know at least basic wave management in order to do so, and to know the limits of the champion, otherwise you'll just kinda int.

---

**Number 5:**

Volibears passive scales extremely well with Ability Power. Not just in raw damage, but also in its attack speed value.

Just getting a tiny bit of Ability Power is enough to make your passive hurt a lot. If you have the choice of going either AD or AP Volibear, I'd recommend AP every time, just for the passive alone. AP Volibear does something that is rather unique, whereas AD Volibear is more akin to playing Sett or Garen with extra steps.

However, don't go full on AP and always opt for a tankier build when playing Volibear, unless you intend to split at every possible moment. A good idea would be to go Chemtank into Hourglass and maybe get a Nashor's Tooth as your only damage item, before going tank again.",leagueoflegends

t3_m6k92g,Request for more transparency and better explanations in Patch Notes,"TL;DR: The  explanation (the text in quotes) for each change in the patch notes is usually unclear and too short. This can make players confused as to why changes are happening which can lead to toxicity in the community, especially towards the devs. This is Riot's opportunity to be transparent with the playerbase, so they shouldn't miss it.

I enjoy reading the patch notes over Mark Yetter's previews mainly for the explanations of each change. Other than this and some last minute balance changes, there's really no reason to read the full patch notes over the preview. The preview is concise and can be read easily in less than 5 minutes. However, it's only missing the key element of transparency. Us players don't know why each balance change occurs, we can only guess. This can lead to frustration or false conclusions. More transparency with each balance change only leads to more understanding between the playerbase and the devs and less toxicity. That's why the patch notes attempt to provide clarity with explanations in quotes for every listed change. However, these explanations are often unclear, too short, or don't explain anything at all.

I'll start with the Akali explanation this patch (11.6):

&gt;From the start of most games, Akali is able to wield her durability to help her coast through even the most difficult early lane phases. We’re reducing her early game tankiness so that her laning success isn't always guaranteed, but in return, we’re giving her an overall net buff  with later dueling payoff, so that when she strikes, it’s *deadly*. In addition, we're also making her energy management more intuitive so that if you’re just now picking her up, it doesn’t take so much… energy? 

For the most part, this is a good explanation. Primarily, it establishes 3 things: 1) Akali is too strong early and needs to be nerfed; 2) she's being compensated with buffs for mid/lategame; 3) her energy management will be easier. But I'm afraid it's not telling the full story. This kind of change is pretty big, so I'm guessing it's a result of the ""Overly skewed towards Pro Play,"" section of the small updates gameplay thoughts outlined last month by Mark Yetter. Basically, he explained that they'll start looking to fundamentally change the kits of certain champions that suffer in soloq due to too much presence in proplay. Akali fits the bill for this type of change. Her soloq winrate has suffered greatly since they've nerfed her for pro and elite levels of play, so it makes sense why they'd want to test this approach on her. If this is true, which I'm pretty sure it is to some extent, I wish they'd mention something about it during this patch explanation. This type of context is what players need so that we're not frustrated when we don't know why change is happening. Otherwise, for all we know, riot is throwing darts at a balance board. Here's how I'd rewrite it:

&gt;In the early game, Akali's laning phase is safer and more threatening than we want it to be. We’re reducing her early game tankiness and trading so that her laning success isn't always guaranteed, but in return, we’re giving her an overall net buff with later dueling payoff. She falls off a bit too hard in the mid and lategame, requiring more effort than other midlane assassins to achieve the same levels of success. However, for those who can pilot her at the top level, she achieves too much for one champion, so in order to buff her other aspects, we'll need to reduce her agency in pro and elite play. Since the early game is more impactful in pro and elite play, our changes are focused to reduce that impact in favor of her other, more soloq focused aspects. In addition, we're also making her energy management more intuitive so that if you’re just now picking her up, it doesn’t take effort where it's unnecessary. This should let her thrive more in soloq by balancing her for more than the highest tier of play.

While I may be incorrect in some of the assumptions I'm making about their reasoning, the point of better context remains. Whatever reasons they may have, I'd like them to put it as best they can in the explanations instead of leaving them unclear. The next example I have is more egregious.

This is the explanation for Leblanc's change this patch (11.6):

&gt; LeBlanc has been feeling chained down and could use some help finding success. We’re opening up more opportunities for her to dash in and out of a kerfuffle. 

This only establishes one thing: Leblanc is bad, so we're buffing her. There's no meaningful explanation here, no clarity, and no context provided for why this change is happening. ""Leblanc is bad, so we're buffing her"" is what we can all assume Riot thinks just by looking at a preview. What I want to know is, ""Why is she bad? Why is she being buffed in this way specifically?"" that way, we'll understand the reasoning behind this decision. Additionally, I fear they're forcing these puns or jokes into the explanations at the expense of clarity. Saying ""Leblanc has been feeling chained down,"" doesn't explain much compared to ""Leblanc's winrate and pickrate in soloq or pro play hasn't hit the target we want for her."" All it does is force a chain pun. Again, since there's no context, I don't know why they're making this change, so in my example of what I'd change, I'll be making some assumptions.

Here's how I'd rewrite it:

&gt;Leblanc's winrate and pickrate is soloq or pro play hasn't hit the target we want for her. This is partially due to how much mana she expends with each fight in the mid and lategame. We're reducing the mana cost of her W at later levels so that it's not as costly for her to engage or escape. This isn't meant to massively impact her but make her gameplay smoother as she transitions out of laning phase.

This is a long post, but I hope you understand what I'm saying. Patch notes are the perfect opportunity for the devs to be transparent with the playerbase about balance, one of the most controversial topics in the community. Even for small changes like the Leblanc one, a bit more context would go a long way. I'd advocate for several paragraph long explanations, for even small changes, as that way it would give further context to the players that want it, since the players that don't care about context don't read it anyway. Without context, it may seem like Riot looks at a low winrate then buffs a random stat to compensate. Riot should try as hard as they can to make sure this doesn't happen.",leagueoflegends

t3_m6cf6u,"Imu'Uy, The Cat","Imu'Uy is a parasitic voidborn tasked by the Watchers to infiltrate Yordle society and harness their power to free their masters. Along with the sentient magic book Tome, who stores the souls of the hosts that Imu'Uy has made use and discarded of, the adventure seeking voidborn is drawn to magic like a moth to a lamp and will stop at nothing to make all the shiny and glittery magic hers. Imu'Uy has no qualms with useless humans and other species, as they do not offer the magical energy needed to further its research and goals. She often forms symbiotic relationships with these lesser species as a risk free way to sustain herself. Unless you're a mage of course, in that case you're a delicious new host.

**Appearance:**

Imu'Uy takes the appearance of a normal cat riding on a worn book bound by leather. When attached, Imu'Uy reveals her true form, growing massive fangs and sharp bird talons as well as merging its two eyes into one compound eye at the center of her forehead. She sprouts two horned tentacles from her shoulders ([Like the ones shown on these guys here](https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dnd/monsters/displacerbeast)) and her tail is lined with sharp barbs. Tome opens to float beside her, revealing the trapped souls of eternal torment within.

&amp;#x200B;

# Abilities

**Passive - Eviscerate N' Escape**

**Innate: Heat Sense,** Imu'Uy relies on heat to choose her next target. She cannot see control wards , farsight wards, or revealed stealth wards unless they are revealed by true sight. Additionally, Imu'Uy cannot use trinkets while attached. 

*Control lens and control wards will grant obscured vision of stealth wards, but not true vision.* 

**Innate:** Periodically, Imu'Uy's next basic attack gains bonus range, steals a portion of her target's movement speed, and grants her a shield that also blocks one immobilizing effect. The shield loses this effect if Imu'Uy attaches to an enemy champion or transfers the shield.

*The movement speed stolen is based on the target's current movement speed, which is then granted to Imu'Uy.*

*Getting another shield while still shielded refreshes the spellshield effect*

|Cooldown: 18 - 6 (Based on level)|Mana Restored: 25 - 100 (Based on level)|Shield: 60 - 400 (Based on level) (+30% AP)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Percentage Movement Speed Stolen: 10 - 35% (Based on level)|Bonus Range: 100||

&amp;#x200B;

**Q - Siphoning Symbiote**

**Active:** Imu'Uy fires a missile in a target direction that grants bonus movement speed to the first allied champion hit for 1 second. The missile also transfers Imu'Uy's shield to the target. The shield lasts until broken, and will not disappear even if Imu'Uy dies.

If the missile is in flight for 1 second, it grants more movement speed and heals the allied champion over 1 second.

While attached, Imu'Uy instead channels for up to 1 second, directing the trajectory of the missile.

*Enemy units and champions can intercept the projectile to destroy it.*

*If Imu'Uy grants another shield onto a champion already posseting one, it will replace the current shield.*

|Cooldown: 14 / 12 / 10 / 8 / 6|Target Range: 1200|Cast Time: None|

|Healing: 50 / 70 / 90 / 110 / 130 (+30% AP)|||

&amp;#x200B;

**W - Me and Me!**

**Passive:** The *Host* loses either a percentage amount of their bonus attack damage or ability power, whichever is higher, and a percentage amount of their armor and magic resist.

Imu'Uy then converts all stolen attack damage, ability power, magic resist, and armor into adaptive force and gains bonus health and mana regeneration based on the adaptive force gained. Imu'Uy starts with a point in *Me and Me!* and Siphoning Symbiote instead has 6 ranks.

**Active:** Imu'Uy channels for 0.25 seconds, then dashes to the target enemy champion upon completion and attaches to them upon arrival. While attached, Imu'Uy is untargetable and casts her spells from her host's position. Additionally, Imu'Uy cannot be targeted by turrets unless she damages an enemy champion while in turret range. The cooldown starts after completing the channel. *Me and Me!* can be recast after 0.5 seconds of attachment.

**Recast:** Imu'Uy switches her host, refreshing the recast. This recast will automatically activate onto the closest enemy champion if her current host dies. If recast without a valid target, or no valid target is in range when Imu'Uy's host dies, she will detach from her host and dash in the target direction, putting this ability on cooldown.

If Imu'Uy is immobilized, *Me and Me!* is put on a 2.5 second cooldown

|Stolen Attack Damage: 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13% Bonus Attack Damage|Stolen Ability Power: 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13% Ability Power|Stolen Magic Resist and Armor: 7 / 8 / 9/ 10 / 11%|

&amp;#x200B;

**E - Crawlies**

**Active:** Imu'Uy accelerates her metabolism, slowing herself and lowering her attack speed for 3 seconds while regenerating health over the duration.

If cast while attached, Imu'Uy uses her hosts's metabolism instead, applying the slow and attack speed debuff to her host.

|Cooldown: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8|Attack Speed Reduction: 25 / 30 / 35 / 40 / 45%|Slow: 15 / 20 / 25 / 30 / 35 (+10% Per 100 AP)|

&amp;#x200B;

**R -** **Epilouge**

**Passive:** While attached, *Crawlies* now causes the host to take percentage bonus damage from all sources for the duration of the ability.

**Active:** Imu'Uy and Tome channel for up to 3.5 seconds, launching 7 waves of trapped souls in the target direction over the duration, each healing any ally champions struck in its path. Ally champions hit only heal for 50% damage from subsequent waves, and when they are struck by three waves, they become ghosted are granted bonus movement speed for 1.75 seconds. This may only occur once per target.

# Visuals

**Idle:**

Imu'Uy appears exactly like a normal cat when not attached to an enemy champion, and sits on Tome in her idle. Tome is always closed when not attached to an enemy champion, but frequently moves and jitters around as if trying to escape its leather binding. For her idle animation, Tome attempts to open before Imu'Uy floats up and playfully bats it. When Tome suceeds in partially opening, Imu'Uy momentarily loses her disguise, unleashing her demonic form and uses her horned tentacles to forcefully shut the book. Then transforms back into a cat, sits back down, purrs, and washes her face.

**Eviscerate N' Escape:**

Imu'Uy uses Yuumi's passive animation, but the beam from her auto attack is purple in color. The shield received resembles a purple green mucous layer.

**Siphoning Symbiote:**

Imu'Uy releases a projectile from book that takes the form of a fleshy blob with wings. Once it flies for 1 second, the blob grows a mouth and starts screaming. If it hits an allied champion, the souls continue to try and claw their way to freedom while the blob assimilates with the champion and heals them. While attached, Yuumi springs out the back of her host and sits on tome to stare intently at the projectile's path.

**Me and Me!:**

Imu'Uy dashes towards and enemy champion before revealing her true form. Tome opens to reveal screaming faces in its pages while Imu'Uy dives directly into the enemy champion. While Imu'Uy is attached to an enemy champion, their level indicator to the left of the health bar is outlined by teeth and bordered purple with green ooze.

**Crawlies:**

Unattached, Imu'Uy lays down on Tome to take a nap while a longer *Zoomies* vfx plays. Attached, Imu'Uy bursts out the back of the enemy champion in a splatter of blood and laughs manically before unsheathing her claws and diving back in.

**Epilouge:**

Unattached, Imu'Uy slashes the leather strap binding Tome and lets souls pour out while hanging on to the back of the book. While attached, Imu'Uy bursts out the back of her host and does the same animation.

**Death:**

Imu'Uy falls off Tome, which opens when it hits the ground. A bunch of souls come shooting out of Tome while the book sprouts several spectral arms which drags Imu'Uy into its pages.

'Now that the path forward for the playoffs is clear, we wanted to be transparent with our fans about a health situation within our LEC team.


Last week, two people at the Fnatic Berlin facility tested positive for COVID-19. They have since been in quarantine and are showing only mild symptoms.


In line with Fnatic internal policies, we asked everyone that has been exposed to our positive cases to
be retested and work remotely.


On receiving the result, our first priority was to set up our team safely, and in a way which ensured we could complete our fixtures. We collaborated with Riot to ensure we could compete in our LEC games as scheduled. We wanted to protect confidentiality and focus on the competition.


Now the weekend has completed, and we can look forward to a playoff place, we're able to update the fans with the facts. We are aiming to return to the Berlin facility as soon as we can. We're confidentthat all our members will soon be fully recovered and ready for an amazing playoffs run.'

t3_m6iyx9,"LS: ""Jiizuke is clearly really really bad at laning""; Peter Dun: ""Jiizuke is the best laning midlaner in the league""","Yesterday Peter Dun, coach of EG, in a new episode of HLL stated that Jiizuke is the best midlaner at laning in LCS. This cought my attention because just the day before, during the live viewing of EG vs CLG, LS stated basically the opposite **""Jiizuke is so clearly bad at laning, if anyone has any sort of idea of what's happening with midlane, right,  he is really really really bad at laning""** Moreover LS stated during his stream, multiple times, how Jiizuke is a bottom 3 midlaner in LCS and has been generally critic (especially his building path and wave managment). LS also put him at 7th in his tierlist.

So I started to wondering **how two people, that are quite known for their knowledge of the game, can have such a different idea on the same player performance**.  Firstly you have to considerate that both LS's and Peter Dun's opinion might be interessed by bias therefore this may account for some of the drastic difference. Peter Dun bias could be due to the fact that Jiizuke is one of his players, meanwhile LS' one might connected to the fact that Nemesis is one of his biggest friend and Jiizuke used to bodied Nemesis in Superliga Orange (Spanish ERL).

Still I think that this is not enough to explain the dyscrasia between the two opinions. So my personal take is that you might explain it thanks to a different concept of the game they might have. For exemple I beleve one thing really important of Jiizuke playstyle is that he always tries to get prio even if this might cost his mana, or some cs, this brings to have a lot of room in terms of plan  for EG. In this exemple LS would be critic because, I guess, he gives more importance to the 1vs1 and exclude it from the general picture; meanwhile Peter Dun might praise it because, again I guess, he gives more importance to the general, macro wise, state of the game than the simple 1vs1.

Obviously since I'm not a professional, altough i watched almost all games of LCS and LEC, **I will like to hear your opinion**

Concluding, I personally like Jiizuke as a player and a person, and I saw there was a lot of criticism broght up especially from the major costreams (LS, IWD and Doublelift are the one i follow the most) and if it can be somewhat fair sometimes it degenerated  to just insults, so I hope that whichever side you will take won't be with a negative attitude.

 so far i see 2 reliable strategies 

1) either take ignite win lane and try to carry however your bot might lose couples dragons and thus come the quote ""top lane island no impact"" 

2) take TP and try to impact bot on the 1st drake fight however this comes at many risks of losing exp from top lane or some plates or even worse losing the bot fight and dragon even 5v4 if engaged badly 

&amp;#x200B;

so for the sake of argument lets say you have equal skill of both knowing how to use ignite advantage to score some kills in lane and knowing how/when to TP bot and score a won teamfight/drake 

with that being said what has the higher probability of consistant winrate between the 2 strategies ?

As justification for these harsh nerfs, Riot stated that Rakan's Flash RW (and RW) initiation combo was far too instantaneous and reliable which made him an overpowered pick in professional play. Yet, with the release of Rell, Riot added another instant CC flash knock up combo. Similar to pre-nerf Rakan, Rell can instantly flash WRE to reliably CC opponents. Just like pre nerf Rakan, Rell has become a priority pick in competitive due to how reliable her engage combo is. 

Below I have provided videos of both the pre-nerf Rakan flash RW combo and Rell's flash combo:

Old Rakan: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loAW44UYC50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loAW44UYC50)

Although the current iteration Rakan is still playable, he is far weaker than other engage support picks due to how telegraphed his engage combo is. Why was the old Rakan combo nerfed so harshly just for Riot to add in another instantaneous CC combo with the addition of Rell?  Do you think Rell will receive any changes to her initiation combo?

&amp;#x200B;

So, lately, I've been practicing new champs to expand my champ pool. I'm not expecting to win every game, because that's unrealistic. 

However, I don't know if this is just me or if it's actually happening more often.

&amp;#x200B;

The question: **Is it just me or are people trolling MUCH more frequently in norms than usual? Or has it always been like this and I'm just noticing this now?**

&amp;#x200B;

It's hit me for the past 2 months because I feel like that's also why I've become more frequently tilted.

I'm not talking about meming. I'm talking about **either legit trolling/ruining games or playing against constant nonmeta bs** (I haven't experienced this 3 months ago, most of my normal games were **normal games just with no stakes**). 

It's even more frustrating because as I'm trying to practice new champions, having to basically relearn my role against nonmeta bs is just so tilting OR as I'm practicing new champions in real games, I can't have true practice as I have to deal with trolling teammates.

I **also play these types of normal games alone so I can actually practice without coordination**, so that I can immerse myself in the ""carry mentality"" for expanding my champ pool.

I have tried reinstalling and logging in/out, restarting my computer and everything like that but this has still been happening for like 2 weeks now. 

Any ideas on how to fix this?",leagueoflegends
t3_m690kn,Dodge Timer for Not Accepting Games That Dont Appear,"5 times in a row I load up league, choose ARAM, sometimes have to switch gamemodes because ""All players arent ready"" and the queue button is disabled. I start queueing only for 30-40 seconds in to be told I failed to join queue or left during champ select, putting me in the infinite queue that I cant exit. Thus loading up league and trying again.   


Now im sitting in a 15 minute dodge timer for games I could never join in the first place.",leagueoflegends
t3_m6t00j,Thought Experiment: Perfect Macro or Perfect Micro,"Being somewhat of a new player to the game, and having researched a decent amount into Macro and Micro, I wanted to present an interesting thought experiment. Obviously, this is unrealistic and potentially even impossible. That's why it's a thought experiment.

**The Perfect Macro Player**: Map Hack: This player is so immensely big brain he/she can deduce exactly where each enemy player is at all times, exactly what is warded, essentially he/she has perfect information of the game, which can then be transferred to his teammates. Also perfect knowledge of where to rotate in response to enemy position/vision. Has average (Silver/Gold) micro.

**The Perfect Micro Player**: Perfect Play: This player lands can always predict enemy movement, skillshots, ability usage, optimal positioning, optimal teamfighting, etc. Essentially, they will make every outplay that is theoretically possible, no matter how big brain and difficult it is. Essentially if you got a supercomputer to calculate exactly what keys to press and where to click to outplay the opponent, given knowledge of exactly how their opponents will respond. Doesn't mean unkillable though, like if they take an ezreal ult from point blank range, they ain't dodging that. They might be able to play perfectly around it though so they win the duel anyways. Cassio ult is 100% slow and 0% stun. Makes the highlight reel/montage play whenever one is available. Has average (Silver/Gold) macro.

Now, consider a DAMWON team where you can replace exactly one player with the **Perfect Macro Player**, and a DAMWON team where you can replace exactly one player with the **Perfect Micro Player**. We shall assume, to isolate the experiment, that these players will have good teamwork and have good comms. 

***When these two augmented teams face off, who would win? Would one crush the other? If so, why? How would they fare against the unmodified DAMWON team? (I'm using DAMWON as an arbitrary theoretical top team, feel free to replace with any other strong pro team).***

Arguments for **Perfect Macro**: Perfect information means:

\- Enemy team will never pull off a successful gank, your ganks will be incredibly successful since you know what is warded, also map will basically be dark for your enemies since you know exactly where wards are and thus can make perfect use of sweepers, or just path around vision. Also the pick potential of out of place opponents would just be insane, while you would never get picked. You'll always outrotate the enemy, giving free turrets, drags, buff steals, invades, etc. (Imagine Canyon with full vision of enemy jungler :o) Also makes flanks in teamfights or whatnot virtually impossible. Essentially, you get a free win on the vision war that is so oftenly seen and so important in Pro Play. They might have trash mechanics, but just get them to play yuumi support and it'd be just fine

Arguments for **Perfect Micro**: Solo carry 1v9 no counterplay potential. 

\- Almost certainly will get giga fed in lane, or at least just crush lane so hard their opponents never become relevant again. With perfect laning, spacing, ability usage/aiming/dodging/outplay, essentially never get solokilled, ganks can result in double kills, etc. Teamfight god who always is in the perfect spot to output maximum dps. Think of 2013-2015 Faker getting solokills in lane and crushing everyone only 5 times more oppressive. Irelia's 1v5-ing the enemy team, by virtue of dodging every single skillshot, that sort of bonkers. Bad macro might not matter since another player can shotcall. Always put them on 1v9 champs that can snowball their lane and have high skillcaps.

Let me know what you guys think! Is the ultimate Macro player more important than the ultimate Micro player? Again, this is all just theoretical, a fun thought experiment, and probably doesn't say much about the actual game. It's just something interesting that caught my attention.",leagueoflegends
t3_m6owvn,Side selection process for LCS/LPL/LEC/LCK,"Does anyone know the official ruling for the side selection process of the big leagues? From my understanding in the one-off games Team A selects (LCS, LEC). While in the LPL/LCK team A chooses game 1 &amp; 3, while Team B select game 2.

Is this correct? I'm just finding it difficult to find any clear answers on these things",leagueoflegends
t3_m72dch,Xin can now dash further to marked targets than Nidalee,"Xin's W is now 1000 range, and his E increases from 650 to 1100 range against marked targets. 

Nidalee's Q may be 1500 range, but her W only increases from 375 to 750. Not to mention that her Q has 1300 missile speed compared to Xin's W's 6250.

So Xin now has, in addition to the kit he already had, a far faster and more reliable version of Nidalee's core combo. 

I just wanted to point this out, since Nid's been struggling performance-wise but seen no adjustments.",leagueoflegends
t3_m6w63b,Why are so many heroes that were meant for mid turned support?,"So i was wondering why so many AP mages like zyra, morgana, lux, karma, vel'koz, xerath, brand etc.. or even the likes of pantheon, ended up more on the support role rather then as midlaners despite their damage and i'd love to hear y'all opinion

t3_m73c1e,"I wish Rumble just didn't get any new skins after Super Galaxy. It really sucks when you love a ""1000+ day with no skins"" champ because even when you expect nothing, you are still disappointed.","The champion model is outdated and clunky. It is passable for a ""scrapyard titan"" theme that his base model has: his machine is rickety, looks inefficient, and it is a few hits away from breaking entirely.

Badlands Baron and Space Groove Rumble absolutely feel like skins that were created because a skin needed to made and there also happened to be themes that the champion could be squeezed into.

The fact that Super Galaxy Rumble got new animations and voice lines only to have all new skins get pasted on top of his base skeleton and animations is just lazy and insulting. The voice of the new skin sounds like Rumble is speaking through one of those [old plastic echoing microphones!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/01/05/d8010527a0530ec8c185128b61155628.jpg) 

I don't expect every new skin to be some new masterpiece but Super Galaxy Rumble highlighted how dated the base model looked *when it was released years ago*. Here we are, 2 skins later, and Rumble is still just some afterthought who is on a list they need to put a checkmark next to while they are working on the real Bread Winner skin lines.

I know I won't have to worry about Rumble skins again until at least 2024 but when that time rolls around I hope that next time Riot will take a second to think about whether Rumble players are even excited about how a new skin would feel to play in-game with the ugly state of the base model they keep putting these skins onto. I guess I am just expected to buy these skins because they are Rumble skins? Even though there is nothing exciting about how they play in-game?",leagueoflegends
