t3_m795ay,r/DotaAnime and Dragon's Blood release - rule changes and guidelines,"With the release date of Dragon's Blood fast approaching (March 25th) we'd like to unveil r/DotaAnime.  Going forward from today, we'll be limiting Dragon's Blood related posts on the main r/dota2 subreddit in favour of keeping the show related content to one subreddit.

The r/DotaAnime subreddit will contain a sticky thread for each release where you can discuss each episode in more depth - spoilers will be allowed in those threads, and also in threads where the text body of the post is marked with spoiler tags.

Going forward there will be a couple of rule changes for r/dota2:

###Allowed

* Announcements/news posts
* Details of the show that may affect, or find their way into the game
* Posts that compare both the game and the Netflix show

###Not Allowed

* Episode discussions (to be kept to the threads on r/DotaAnime)
* Lore discussions as a result of the show (that could lead to spoilers)
* Screenshots with possible spoilers

For both subreddits, posts with spoilers in titles will be removed, likewise text in posts without using the spoiler tag.

The reason for these new rules is that although we, and many of you, are excited about seeing the new Netflix show, not everyone is, so we want to keep the subreddit focused on the game, while still enabling discussion about the show on the new subreddit.",DotA2

however. **ES Fissure does not.** I've tired it from all sort of angles and tested allied Fissures and enemy Fissures, all enemies will pass through them, not stunning them

**Chronosphere and Spear**  
If the target was already inside the Chrono and was speared, the target will be dragged, potentially dragging them out of the Chrono

BUT  
If the target was out of the Chrono and then speared into it, they will freeze of the edge of the bubble

# ROSH PIT

Rosh pit is probably the most inconsistent and weird area in the map for the Spears.  
From my testing is seems like all the ""walls"" in the pit don't act like walls at all since all the spears will just drag enemies thru the ""walls""  


[Red: drag thru. Green: Stun](https://preview.redd.it/4iweo4wpo1o61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e965cff80c6073c81d79249bbfd8f502c4be644b)

That's because that ""lava fountain"" in the pit acts like a cliff, whereas the ""walls"" don't  
You can see this by using **Spiderlegs** in the pit

Hello everyone and welcome to this Dota 2 guide for Spirit Breaker, One of my favorite heroes and my most played. I've been meaning to write hero specific guides for a long time and thought ""why not start with the hero I know best?""

This guide will be in the form of questions I expect players would have about Spirit breaker. It's something new I wanna try so bear with me if it's not your cup of tea. Without further ado, let's begin.

# Hero Overview

**Is Spirit Breaker worth playing right now?**

Spirit Breaker is in a mediocore place right now, he's not good at laning and his roaming potential is a bit lackluster. He's just not very impressive during the early game. However he does posses a ton of magic immunity piercing potential. He is tanky and in aggressive lineups SB shines with his chasing potential.

**Alright tell me about Spirit Breaker's starting stats, are they any good?**

SB has some very impressive starting stats along with some pretty bad ones. The positives include his starting hp of 780, which is one of the highest health pools at the start of the game. SB also comes with 4 hp regen and almost 5 armor. Combine that with 65 average starting damage, this would put SB as one of the better traders during the laning stage if it wasn't for some.... issus the hero has.

**Issues? What sort of issues?**

While SB has some big positives at the start, it's more than balanced by his weaknesses. For a start as a melee hero he has to actually reach his enemy to do damage, something difficult with his 290 movement speed (only 4 melee heroes are slower). This slow movement speed makes the actual trading part not happen most of the time. Another big issue that SB suffers from is having the 2nd slowest base attack speed in the game. Most heroes have 1.7 attack speed with a few exceptions. SB has 1.9 base attack speed, reducing the effectivness of his high starting damage because he simply doesn't swing his weapon fast enough to abuse it.

# Abilities

**What makes Charge such a good spell?**

Cool, let's talk about SB's abilities now. Charge of darkness is an amazing ability. SB can target anyone on the map and charge towards them with insane speed. While charging SB provides flying vision of the enemy, meaning that it is impossible to juke while being charged. All enemies are bashed along the way as well.

**Did you just....describe Charge without giving me any new information?**

Fair enough, here are some cool tricks about Charge that make the ability so amazing.

* While you cannot target a magic immune person to charge, if you charge someone and they turn magic immune, they still get bashed when SB reaches them. So don't cancel a charge just because the enemy used BKB.

[Although you couldn't Charge magic immue targets directly, you can still bash them along the way. A good method to do so is to stand beside your target and charge something else.](https://preview.redd.it/eyawfqllizn61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ca3a3d0c631ad464e3c87ea735286e1e5b1157)

[Smell my fart, Lifestealer.](https://preview.redd.it/rsibpvjqizn61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c502527e4a7ce90ba8e04653548cbaaf036e1c0)

* Charge provides assist gold to SB, regardless of whether he reaches his victim or not. So long as an enemy hero is being charged and dies, SB gets assist gold no matter what. This means it's always worth charging an enemy your team is trying to kill. SB provides flying vision and gets a bounty out of it.
* In teamfights, always charge the furthest enemy away. It's very easy to bash multiple people while charging. Don't charge the frontline Mars/Underlord, you'll only stun them. Instead aim for the backline heroes like CM and Oracle, which allows SB to bash everyone between them.
* Try to ensure that the Charge path doesn't pass by Roshan. Roshan WILL bash you and that bash can cost your team valuable kills. Nothing is worse than losing a kill due to a Roshan bash and then having your teammates describe the many ways in which they met your mother.
* Due to his low attack speed, enemies can often turn on their magic immunity and teleport away, all while SB gets 1-2 attacks off them. If charge is online though, you can just stand next to the enemy and charge anyone on the map, giving you a 100% chance to stop their TP. Make sure to position Spirit Breaker in such a way that it looks like you're farting in the enemy's face, for maximum value.

**Is Charge completely nullified by Linken's sphere?**

If SB is being a nuisance, a lot of good players will get a Linken so that they can just avoid the headache of being charged. This is especially true of heroes who wanna split push and not get caught by SB (Nature's Prophet, Clinkz, Tinker).

This is very difficult to counter but there are 2-3 ways to get around an enemy that has linkens.

1. SB has to work together with a hero who has another single target spell. For example Shadow Shaman. SB can break Linkens globally and Shaman can then follow up with hex or shackles. It's fine if Shaman breaks Linken and charge goes off as well. This requires quite a lot of communication and coordination to pull off though, so expect it to Always work in your pubs ;)
2. Because Charge changes target to the nearest enemy once the initial target dies, it's possible to charge the nearest creep to the enemy with Linken and wait (well hope) for it to die and then SB will automatically aim for the enemy hero. This completely bypasses Linken but requires a lot of luck to work. Still it can be done. Across over 1k games with SB, I've pulled off this manouver at least twice.
3. Of course, this works both ways. If you have another hero who has the hunting capabilities, you can help him cancel the enemy's Linkens from a global range, effectively nullifying the Linkens pickup.

**I see some pros max Charge and others max Bash first, why is that?**

While Charge is incredible, it's rare to max first because it just doesn't provide much benefit to do so early. Charge bonus speed starts at 300 and goes all the way up to 375 at max level, not much of an increase. The cooldown does decrease substantially as it levels up, from 17 seconds to 11. Yet in most early skirmishs getting multiple charges off simply isn't feasible due to how fights are decided in 5 seconds.

Charge does get maxed out in few pro games when the team feels they want this nonstop aggression all over the map. Still this is rare and maxing Bash first is the standard because it impacts all of Spirit Breaker's damage early and deleting enemies &gt; stunning them.

**I hear a lot about ""charge this"" and ""bash that"". How come Bulldoze hasn't been mentioned?**

Because Bulldoze is a fairly straightforward spell. There really isn't much to it. It adds 30% movement speed and 70% status resistence at max level. Still here are some tricks you can do with it.

* Bulldoze should be used at the start of fights when most spells are being thrown out. It's when SB will get the most benefit out of the status resistence of the spell.
* Bulldoze IS DISPELLABLE!. While this fact is useless in most games, it does mean that SB should use Bulldoze After being hit by Oracle's Fortune's End, Invoker's tornado and any Euls on the enemy team.
* Consider using Bulldoze to tank some spells for allies when you can. An example of this is if you think an ally is going to be hit by Mirana's arrow, then turn on Bulldoze and tank it, it will stun SB at max by 1.5 seconds, compared to someone else for 5 seconds.
* When chasing enemies that are really far and hard to catch (Tinker, Nature's prophet). Use Bulldoze immediately while charging them for the boost of speed. You get 8 seconds of bonus speed rather than ""saving it"" when you get near them and only benefitting from 2-3 seconds of bonus movement speed.

**Does Greater Bash have any tricks to it?**

Greater Bash does a % of SB's movement speed as damage. It famously procs 17% of the time using a pesudo-random modifier. There isn't much players can do to influence this but there are a few things to keep in mind.

* Since it's pseudo-random, it's possible to ""wind up"" the bash by hitting anything a few times to increase the chance of the next attack being a bash. This is (in my opinion) usually not worth it because you never if a bash will trigger while winding it up. A couple of hits with no bash would usually be the best you can get.
* Bash pushes people in the direction SB is facing, so try to always position yourself so you push them towards your allies/away from enemies.
* Similar to the above point, Bash can push people up/down cliffs and into safety. So be very careful when fighting near impassable terrain. Bash can even push people out of Kinetic field and Mars' ultimate. Take a second to better position yourself so you don't accidentally save enemies by bashing them to safety.

**Nether Strike got nerfed a while back and now it's slowly being buffed again, How good is the ulti right now?**

A long long while back, NS used to do 150/250/350 damage on an 80/70/60 second cooldown. Right now it does 100/175/250 on 90/75/60 second cooldowns. It's fair to say the spell has lost quite a bit of power over the last couple of years.

The new shard upgrade is incredible though and turns NS from a mediocre ultimate to a pretty damn good one. Even without shard, there are still some good tricks you can do with NS.

* When attacking from fog/invisibility, consider using NS first before charge. NS pushes enemies twice the distance as a regular bash. You can follow up with a charge after to push enemies almost 500 distance out of position
* Enemies always expect SB to charge in first and then use his ulti. Use this to defend/siege highground. Especially while defending you can ulti someone into your base and charge them further in. This trick has turned countless losing games into a win for me.
* If you're facing an enemy with Linken and you gotta decide whether to break it with Charge or NS, always use Charge. Charge's low cd makes it a lot more expendable.
* Nether Strike is a type of ""Blink Strike"" similar to Phantom Assasin and Riki. This means you can use it defensively to get out of sticky situations.

**Is Spirit Breaker's skill build set in stone or do I have a lot of wiggle room?**

SB has a somewhat fixed skill build, generaly maxing Bash first and then Charge. You also want to put points in the ulti whenever you can and a value point early in Bulldoze is worth it. There are a few levels where you'll have to make a choice between two viable option thought.

**Level 1: Bash or Charge?**

At level 1 you gotta decide if you want to take a point in Bash or Charge. Bash gives you more damage, better trading and can proc 2-3 times in the 17 seconds it takes to use Charge. It also works well with a starting orb of venom. Charge gives you a guaranteed 1.2 sec stun, and it allows SB to close the distance to the enemy. It's weaker in the lane though.

Personally I almost always take Bash level 1 because it allows me to trade more effectively. Charge feels mostly pointless because SB goes in, does zero damage and then....nothing. I think both are viable but Bash seems a lot more useful level 1.

**Level 4: Charge level 2 or Bulldoze?**

At level 4 (assuming you take 2 levels of bash at level 3) a second level of Charge is an option or you can put a value point in Bulldoze. Bulldoze puts a bigger strain on SB's limited mana pool but the bonuses it provides are pretty sizeable. A second level of charge lowers it's cooldown, which is also helpful.

I generally go for Bulldoze at this point, it just gives too much value to ignore. However a second level in charge is ok if your team is dumpstering the enemy and lower cooldown gets you more involved.

**Level 10: First talent point or max Charge?**

Spirit Breaker's level 10 talents are.....fine. I'll discuss both options in the talent section but both are decent options. Maxing Charge at level 10 has the potential to provide a lot for your team. Going from 13 to 11 seconds cooldown is very useful. Talents can provide a lot of utility or extra armor, both are helpful as well.

Level 10 offers several options that boil down mostly to personal preference. Expirement a bit and take what you like at this level.

# TALENTS

**Not a whole lot of customization for skills. Are Talents flexible at least?**

I'd say about 3 of the talents are pretty flexible and 1 talent is set in stone. Let's go through all the choices.

**At level 10 +500 Night Vision has an almost 3% winrate increase over 4 armor, is it really that good?**

Extra night vision is really nice to have because most enemies will be limited to 800 vision at night while Spirit Breaker has 1300, that's a lot of vision to work with. Vision talent is very useful if you put SB at the front of the team as he'll be able to provide a lot more information at night than almost any other hero.

Another major benefit of extra night vision is that smoke breaks at 1025 distance, which means at 800 night vision, most heroes don't realize they broke enemy smokes till it's too late. However, if SB takes the night vision talent, you'll know exactly when and where enemies are when you reveal them.

When you compare how much utility Night Vision gives you, 4 armor feels pretty tame in comparison. With 4 armor enemies can hurt you a little less physically (although their Tipping still hurts emotionally). That doesn't make it a bad talent at all, just a little more limited in what it can provide.

**The level 15 talent choice is even more one-sided, isn't 40 damage incredible?**

Uhh.... Not on Spirit Breaker. Remember his 1.9 base attack speed? Second lowest in the game?

And let's not forget the glorious agility gain of....1.7? Those are some wolves of Icewrack values right there.

Spirit Breaker simply doesn't attack fast enough to make use of the damage value, nor is building attack speed items worth it. Compared to that you can get 10 hp regen, which is a lot more reliable. Spirit Breaker is always in the thick of fights and the extra regen makes a difference in surviving those engagements. It's a no brainer at level 15.

**Aghhh! Both level 20 talents look great, Which do I pick?**

SB has some great late game talents, and level 20 is a really tough choice. Reducing Bulldoze to 10.5-second cooldown gives you near 100% uptime, while the bash talent is an extra 37% damage to all bashes.

This really comes down to preferences, cause both talents can do a lot. Using Bulldoze 2-3 times a fight just makes Spirit Breaker uncontrollable for the enemy team. My only issue with this talent is that Bulldoze IS dispellable, which makes this talent not worth it in games vs many dispels. Other than that this talent is always good.

Bash talent is a bit more offensive and I take it if I feel like my team is ahead. It also works really well if Spirit Breaker has Aghanims. The extra damage adds up in that situation. I also like how this talent allows SB to actually kill lane creeps with his charge.

Honestly, there is no wrong talent choice here, even taking Bulldoze cooldown isn't too bad vs dispels, just less optimal. So take what you prefer.

**There is no winrate difference between the level 25 talents. Are they equally effective?**

The level 25 talents for Spirit Breaker are just amazing. 650 extra health allows him to tank so much in a fight. If you want to survive longer in fights, it's the obvious choice to take.

The 20% extra bash chance is more interesting though. At 37% chance to bash, SB can almost guarantee a bash every 3 hits and at level 25 he (kinda) has the attack speed to pull it off without any attack speed items.

Let's assume that with his level 25 talent, Spirit Breaker can completely shutdown 1 enemy. There are still some things to consider. Does the enemy have 1 magic immune carry that nobody else can handle? Does Spirit Breaker have a BKB to allow him to hit the enemy carry nonstop?

It may sound like I think the 20% bash talent is worse but honestly, they are both great. It just takes a little more to get the bash talent to work. But if you can make it work, it's an insane amount of magic piercing lockdown that SB can provide.

# Conclusion

Originally I wanted to write everything about Spirit Breaker in one post but this is long enough as it is. I'll be doing part 2 which will include item builds and gameplay. I'll also include good questions we get in this post if they cover something I haven't thought of.

I hope you all enjoyed this post, it was a real joy writing about my favourite space cow and hopefully, it helps a few of you appreciate him a little more. Till next time!

difference between cast-time and 1st attack, intervals between attacks are explained by enemy target's position and these factors:

&gt;Jex rotates around Dark Willow  
&gt;  
&gt;The attack radius is centered on Jex  
&gt;  
&gt;The attack projectiles traveling at a speed of 1400

&amp;#x200B;

upd1: right positioning gives first hit 0.03s after cast (next server tick) [https://imgur.com/a/JzA0oN6](https://imgur.com/a/JzA0oN6) Still only 19 hits

upd2: [https://i.imgur.com/sLku1gq.png](https://i.imgur.com/sLku1gq.png) Bedlam attack profectile deals damage after Bedlam buff ended so it's not restricted with Bedlam buff duration.

&amp;#x200B;

As first hit is possible 0.03s after cast there should always be at least 20 attacks within 5s with 0.25s interval.

Some of you guys might know me for the ET carry antics that I went through in top 100 pubs last year. 

Still a memer at heart, still fucking around 99% of the time.

I wanted to reach out to r/dota2 letting you guys know that I'm opening up 21 slots for free coaching sessions for the month of April (and end of March). Signups are gonna be on my discord server so stop by, hang out and let's get a sesh going :D. All the free sessions are going to be on my Wednesday and Saturday streams from 3-8pm PDT and 9-2pm PDT respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

Format goes as follows:

Wednesday/Saturday:

3pm/9am to 4pm/10am: Scheduled sesh (this is the one you can sign up for!)  
4pm/10am to 5pm/11am: Scheduled sesh  
5pm/11am to 6pm/12am: Scheduled sesh  
6pm/12pm to 7pm/1pm: Giveaway from previous stream (this is to give people a chance even if you are a little late to the party)  
7pm/1pm to whenever: Community replays (Write down your replay id in twitch chat and I'll quickly review it for 5-15 minutes)

&amp;#x200B;

**How do I apply:**

* Join the discord below.
* Read the rules placed at the top of the signup channels (wednesday signups or saturday signups)
* Watch the stream tomorrow to know when I am opening up the channels.
* Apply using the format DIRECTLY on the channel sign up page. (This is so there are no arguments over who was first. Whoever's comment is on top, gets the slot.)
* First come first serve.

&amp;#x200B;

To be eligible for the free coaching, you need to be on the discord and stay on even after securing a slot. This is so I can avoid it losing track of people or not knowing their discord Id for messaging.

&amp;#x200B;

**Note: if you are unable to get a coaching session or if you would like to do one outside of Wednesday or Saturday, I also do paid coaching for $18 per session(roughly an hour). Paid sessions have a few extra benefits vs free sessions as well.**

Please write down any questions if you guys have any. I'm here to help :D

I don't know what happened (in the past few months especially), but every/every other game, its profile levels 25-40, with absurd winrates on heroes such as Brood/Meepo/Morph/IO/Ursa etc. And I don't see them being stopped. 

I hope Valve addresses this before the influx of new players with the anime around the corner.

I used to play this game a while back with my friends, sadly as time went on we all had to quit and go on with life. we used to play this game everyday but now as they're busy with work/family i find myself reminiscing about the past. One thing that i didn't get to do with my friends was to learn about how to get good at the game, when we partied up it was always a given that we would play for fun. most of my games with them are a collection of thrown matches and laughing and screaming, we would like to compete in who had the highest mmr but we dont grind it together and everyone of us played solo when playing competitively so in that order i didnt get to learn from them at the time we left the game. as i come back i want to learn, i want to experience firsthand how pros and seasoned players play this game so i beseech you please take me with you in normal match even just 1 or 2 games of your time    


TLDR: Seasoned DotA players I beseech you please take me with you as you play on normal match even just for 1-2 games,i want to observe, i want to experience, i want to see first hand what and how you guys play. Ill play support in all matches so please take me with you.",DotA2

Ehhh well it took all of 1 weekend for that to sour because as I learned this mofo is toxic AF. Long story short I got on his rig and played a few matches of super low behavior score turbo DOTA, and holy shit was it a shock, here's what I learned:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ppl in the 3000 bscore range spend more time crying report more than they actually play DOTA. No shit I must have seen the word report a few hundred times a match. Half way through one match I unmuted 2 pre-muted people and they were also crying report despite knowing full well that likely no one was seeing their text but themselves LoL!
2. They like to spend time congratulating the people they allegedly report on their upcoming low-priority games despite being inches away from going there themselves. This must be an intentional way of trapping the worst shitters together because they just blow reports on each other all day and never climb higher. 
3. All communication comes after the fact. What I mean is they don't act as a team and communicate prior to something happening. The text spam and the voice comms yelling only come after someone died or the team was wiped, heading into it there's no talking or coordinating at all just pure reactionary rage.
4. On the subject of communication the number of non-English speakers (this was US realms I'm on) was about 50% per match. This one is more on Valve because putting people who cant understand each other together is just a recipe for disaster. And yes, I did see racism in 2 of the games as a result of English vs Spanish fighting.
5. Dying is always someone else's fault. The thing that seemed to start every ragefest was someone getting killed and then blaming everyone else. Even when they had vision of an incoming gank, even when it was a stupid play like a dive into a full rota, even when it was just a matter of being outplayed, every single fkin time ragers went after their own team. 

I could go on but these few things stood out as pretty amazing. I've never really seen DOTA at this level before and it was quite the experience. I seriously hope that this new overwatch system isn't actually having to deal with reports from people who are obviously just mad and sending them in for no good reason because that seems like a huge fruitless waste of time.",DotA2

I don’t understand how Valve thinks this is ok? First off the whole new player thing, I’ve got a guy just trying his best mid getting dumpstered by someone several ranks above him and teammates now blaming him. How is a brand new player supposed to move past this and learn to enjoy the game if there’s no punishment for someone getting their rocks off destroying new players?

**\* Couriers can use items after dying once and not upgraded with hero**

&amp;#x200B;

\* Some relic cannot be upgraded in Turbo mode, such as AA’s Ice Blast Damage

**\* Severe courier bug in Turbo mode**

**To repro this:**

**1.** **Toggle Auto Deliver off**

**2.** **Courier has item**

**3.** **Hero has item too, and has empty slot**

**4.** **Put one item on the ground**

**5.** **Let courier deliver and pick up the item on the ground with SHIFT**

**6.** **Before courier reaches the item, let hero pick up the item**

**Result:**

**Courier will follow hero, causing abuse with Gem (when hero is about to die, put Gem on the courier)**

**Expected:**

**Courier will go back in the No.5 step**

\*Power Cogs can't affect units already affected by other force-movement effects

\*When Power Cogs affects a negative-status-resistance unit, the stun time and knockback distance is set to a max number, causing stun and knockback end earlier than expected

So come cheer on ""Intothebreach"" as they go up against The Astronauts. A Five stack Finnish team who went the distance against Burning Fire. 

Also through in the upper bracket Is Bald the Gorc led stack who got past Plan B Esports, breaking only three keyboards and two monitors in the process. It was no surprise to most the Ghost Frogs stack defeated Meta4pro 2-0 in short order, sending them down to the lower bracket. 

The two lower bracket games kick off at 5pm followed by the upper bracket games at 8pm. so come cheer on a UK org. You can follow the team on intothebreachtv on twitch, where they was fun and some good bants. 

Check out the liquipedia page for more info and details. Good luck to everyone in the next round.

Why should good behaviour score supports have to paired with lower behaviour score cores? 

Isn't part of the process and consequences of their actions leading to their lower behaviour score the fact that they have to wait longer for games? 

Please add an option to avoid varied behaviour score games, certainly HIGHLY VARIED behaviour score games. Otherwise, it's another mark against the whole behaviour score thing being a placebo to make things 'feel' better.

So, what do I do? I don't think I'll enjoy the game for much longer to endure getting past these low ELO ranks by myself and I don't have other low ELO friends so queueing with friends it's not an option.

However, the wards were placed about 30 seconds before the beginning of the replay. I clicked the inspect button to see what hero placed them but it just said anonymous.  


I think it would be more useful to replace ""Anonymous"" with the hero's name like it does for the player who un-paused. Mock-up posted below.

t3_m8eas9,Suggestion: Popular Dota pros could help design skins for their signature heroes,"The champion of the Capcom Cup 2019: Street Fighter tournament, iDom, had a specific skin that he helped design. In addition, iirc his version of the skin for his personal account has a unique color or accessory that ONLY HE has access to.

This made me think, what if certain popular players known for their signature heroes helped design a new skin for those exact heroes?

Imagine a Jerax Earth Spirit, Puppey Chen, Maybe Bloodseeker, Topson Monkey King, Yapzor Rubick, Fn Tusk, Universe Earthshaker, Ana Io, Ceb Axe, Miracle Invoker, Gh Phoenix, Insania Oracle, CCNC Leshrac, w33 Templar Assassin, and more! You could even do it for Dota personalities like a Slacks Techies and Sunsfan Pango! And when they play them in tournament, the players have a unique color or accessory just for them!

I've seen couriers made in collaboration with certain teams and some skins (from way way back) made in collaboration with certain players so I'm reasonably sure this could be done.

t3_m8e1d8,What can a carry expect from a support?,"I've always been a carry player and I've always been the type of guy to tell me support to do something if I want him to do it. But sometimes I always feel so frustrated, like why can't they do these basic things themselves, without needing me to tell them.

For example, the majority of supports, I feel like, never buys salves, never pulls, are really bad at harassing without drawing aggro, which I feel like is so basic, I shouldn't even have to ask them to do these things.

The other way around, supports should also expect things from the carry. For example being able to farm efficiently, knowing when to join fights, knowing how to play in fights, buying the correct items and so on.

Can I expect these things from a support, or am I just the typical toxic pos1 who blames everyone for my own mistakes?

I thought about this because in my games today I understand when someone should be dead and how we should win a team fight, but after the fights talk about not being able to cast everything right, ex. Fighting a BB and activating silver edge during the fight to break amoung other things but misclicking the order or clicking on the wrong target to hit etc. 

I'm lower mmr but I like to think I understand the game a little more than what my rank says, however mechanically I'm pretty slow to click buttons or or react with a quick blink away, that stuff, which as seen today is costly. So what do you guys think of the impact difference between mech skills and understanding how to win the game.",DotA2

&amp;#x200B;

I did a short load time study with the games I have using this laptop:

RTX 2060m, i7 9750h, 8GB (Dual-channel RAM), 7200 RPM HDD

&amp;#x200B;

Load times:

Dota 2: 1:00 (Initial loading) 1:00 (Before UI is fully functioning) 0:53 (Loading in, into game)

Giving Dota 2 credit, UI load time is excluded, total load time: 1:53

RE3: 38 seconds (from Initial loading all the way to fully functioning in-game)

Sekiro: 37 seconds (from Initial loading all the way to fully functioning in-game)

Hitman 3: 1 minute (from Initial loading including navigating UI to in-game)

&amp;#x200B;

As you guys can see, Dota 2 loading time is absurdly absurdly long. This is not even including the freeze time when you disconnect from a game (game turns black for awhile). Please do not blame our HDD for this, even with HDD other AAA title load within reasonable amount of time. For once, please use this information to call out Valve for their lack of maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 100% sure this load times is due to the game loading unnecessary amount of assets (eg. Even after-match post has 3d rendering of the map behind, and I am sure Valve being lazy af didn't even truncate the map used to render this background).",DotA2

When you get a new medal(for instance from archon 4 to 5, anciente 5 to divine 1 etc), especially with a winstreak. In the next game you get fierce ruiners with whom you cannot win. I have proofs.  If you think that I am another weak player in low mmr, then you should know that I was a fool and had only 1500 mmr and behaviour ""1"". Now in a month I have upgraded to 3200mmr and behaviour ""3296"". Cause I have big goal and  work on myself every day.  

Since this topic is the first part of the proof, I'll start with fresh ones. I had 11 wins in a row and got a medal Legend 2. (After (03/18/21 -tinker 17:38) game I got a new medal).As you can see, after the new medal there are 4 games (1 victory and 3 losses). And you say, ""Well, why are you cheating, you got a new medal and won right away. Where are the ruiners? And you are to blame for three defeats.""  Let's check details of these games

https://preview.redd.it/kdkrjg11gyn61.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4a29c65fdd45d605676877bf711f794692ef05f

# 2. Game details:

1. **Jungle Spectr and Enigma**. So I was solo on WW and had to try hard and **play like core.**  Both ruiners were farming together until me and od started killing all over the map. As a result, I won the game but I felt bad from this game

https://preview.redd.it/upnqzl07vyn61.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02932083485b83cf14c370e1e0f55f8c04a22dcb

2.  The second game was even worse. We have an AA team who wants to build midas. He plays for up to 4 minutes and after the deaths he goes to my forest (stacks for the tinker) and starts farming midas.

3.  If you think that in the second game, people ruined because they lost the lane, etc. Then here is the third game for you)). Our pos 5 who have name ""мрази на корах"" translated like asshole cores. asshole pos1/2/3, ashole team.  writes that he **does not want to play the game and go double mid and feed.** Аs always, I did not give up and won the mid, helped the team. We even dominated the map. I had a big advantage. Void continued to feed, not give us neutral items etc.

4.  Then I continued to lose mmr and as you can see in game 4 already at 10 minutes **I have amulet pos 5 and pos 1**.  Despite of that I won mid and kill everybody in the map or we comeback with team. That ruiners never play and stay AFK

# SO, thats the first part of my proofs:

If you also had this or think that this is only the first time for me and you need more proof. Then I am ready to do the second part in which the situation is identical before receiving the medal of the legend, archon 5,4 etc.   Nowadays, I lost 120-150 mmr and I just won't play for several days to remove this hidden balance. However, this does not always work like this, and moreover, it can last up to 1-2 months. There was a case when I switched to hero 5, I had 10 losing streak in a row. I go once the hidden pool remains, I go in a week it remains, then o**nly after 1.5 months the hidden balance was removed** and I started to move further. Overcame 10 losestreak, switched back to archon 5,  legend 1 and returned to this hidden balance)))  Again wait some weeks after removing hidden ballance back to dota? and achieve legend 2

**High behaviour** can no longer be obtained through my computer. No matter how hard I try, it takes a very long time to rise. I do not use micro and chat. Sometimes I just write my opinion on the game or calm down my teammates. For this reason I raised mmr and behaviour",DotA2

Slight wall of text below

Basicly the Legion in the game gets some very suspicious dewards off in the early game, and some game winning pickoffs in the late game without any vision over the target. However, at other times throught the game he also gets picked off in some very questionable positions. Suspicious moments include a deward around the 2:00 minute mark which he inferred without any information gathered prior to it. Another one is dewarded around the 7:30 mark. Right after that I go to secure the bottom rune which he feels compelled to ping out. I did scout out the ward earlier and mentioned that there was a ward there, and it is also possible that the buddy in his stack (the Ember) told him the location, however seeing as he got those two previous dewards so easily, I will not give him the benefit of the doubt. However, the most egrigeous moment must have to be at the 39:30 minute mark to the 40:00 minute mark, where he traces the WK pretty well without any vision. Now, it  could be that he inferred that from the creeps dying, but there are other moments where he manages to get pickoffs without any vision over his target so again, I am not giving him the benefit of the doubt. With all that said, there are also other moments like around the 40:00 minute mark that makes me doubt the validity of my hunch. 

Also, I am the Earth Spirit if it makes any difference : P",DotA2
t3_m84pga,"Spells/items almost off cooldown, if given a cast command, should be queued to be casted once off cooldown","In league of legends there is this feature where if your spell is almost off cooldown (e.g. 0.5 seconds of cooldown left), if you give a cast command, instead of the game telling you it can't be casted yet, it registers and queues up a cast command. Then the moment the spell is off cooldown, if no other order has been given, the spell is casted.

In Dota I think you can already do this when stunned (someone please confirm), meaning when you're stunned and you give a command, your hero performs the action immediately once the stun wears off. It would be very stupid if the hero refuses to acknowledge the command and you have to wait till the stun wears off to cast the spell. Same situation here.

**Examples of situations where this might be helpful:**

Puck's blink is disabled by acid spray, put on 3-second cooldown. Puck phase shifts for 3.25 seconds. Whole enemy team is waiting for Puck. Puck has a 0.25-second window to blink out before phase shift ends and blink dagger is disabled again.

Right now the only thing you can do is spam press the crap out of your blink dagger, spamming the spellhotkey and leftclick, hoping your spell cast makes it through in that 0.25 seconds. If you spam too quickly you might double tap blink dagger (instead of tap blink dagger + left click) and blink towards fountain when you wanted to blink somewhere else. If you spam too slowly you miss the 0.25 second window and die.

With this change you don't actually have to spam",DotA2

t3_m8e1an,Dota 2 : State of the game.,"Dota 2 has many issues with it.  It doesn't reward the player for playing its an ever punishing game if you win you get 30 mmr , if you lose you lose 30 mmr  why can't the game give 30 mmr for winning and take away 29 mmr for losing at least that way you are making some sought of progress as experienced players should't be playing with bad players and noobs purely because they have trash cursed luck every game and get bad team mates.  You end games as highest thing on team  24 /2 /11 but can't do anything cause opposing team has that skywrath scripting mage at 40/1/2.    Game has no surrendor button and its about time it got included  or at the very least there should be an option once you type ""GGbye"" or something  you cannot die to people who prolong game on purpose instead of finishing  but at the same time you can no longer do any damage or kill any opponent. This will give players the incentive to end instead of just kill you for 15 minutes while you can't do nothing.      Some heros never get buffs /nerfs and every hero should get random buff and nerfs to change up there playstyle.    Why can't  we get a pregame system similar to what is in league of legends it would add even more strategy complexity to the game like customising our talent tree with a choice of 4 different skills a choice of extra mana regen or extra health regen etc or a choice of 100 extra starting gold.    Why can't an Ai take over when a real player leaves the game even a basic ai controlling a champ would help slightly if  a team mate leaved game and it should keep its gold etc so the team can upgrade /change its items.     Gold does nothing when a player leaves as you can't farm as safely when a team mate leaves. Gold does nothing by itself ,  I strongly believe that the team should get more xp and additional wards  and a sentry ward reduction cost as your losing a player who has vision and contributes.   When a player leaves the game they should get a punishment mode but instead just lose more mmr e.g 59 for example or even 89 (2 wins and 1 lose) its basically the same punishment to get back to where you are without having to play random hero garbage and playing heros you can't and don't want to play for 10 -20 hours on bad days to get out of punishment mode and the people left in the game once someone leaves can just leave the game and lose 29 (the new rate).     I have over 4000 games played and have 54% win rate on my main heros let still have below 1000  mmr why? because my team is garbage , i ask team to push when 4 dead they farm jungle.   I ask team to group up they split up and die.  People throw when they see heros they don't like  me playing which is garbage when I am on 11 win streak and need one more to get that 12th win to break my record for number of games won in row on the hero.  The game is dying and A anime about dota won't change that. Finally needing a 100 games now to play dota rated is ridicilous as most smurfs have accounts from years and years ago so it makes no difference anyway.   Also regarding dota 2 with maps why don't they cycle the map layouts they used previously in older patches  and reinclude the side shops on those maps??? This would also make the game way more interesting as monkey king for example as people might not remember every tree placement like i do on a single map and make disguise useful.  It would also help players who learned these maps in the past and make the game more interesting as paths etc are different and hence there would be more interaction.  Also bring back all the items in some way or in the pre game strategy section allow one of the removed items to be bought as a rule breaker for example i would like my orge to be able to purchase two stout shields (titty shields ) again for roleplaying purposes. One more thing when we plant trees with iron branch why can't they be permant on the map till cut down? they should also allow players to deny wards placed by there idiot team mates on camps as people do it to grief.

t3_m8dqxr,Oracle makes it too easy for Supports to killsteal - Change my mind,"Hey guys,

 

Yesterday I played Oracle. Normally its my gf playing him and I'm not complaining, she's a great level 27 Oracle and plays well - but there's this one thing.. The killsteals.

Whenever we play a lane together, I get the impression that she ""secures"" safe kills, so basically just takes them. Since I'm an aggressive player I never bothered to really play these save supports and didn't look too much into Oracle. I know enough to recognize there's the heal that doubles as a burst of damage.

So after confronting her on killstealing so many times that I'm wondering why we are still together (joke) I decided to try something. So next game, unfortunately without her -  the point still is the same - I picked Oracle. A friend of mine was the Carry player. And I took kills. Until the Lategame I didn't even try too hard to take the kills, it came naturally.

Obviously the game was a stomp, but still - I got 15 kills of which only like... 5 were actively stolen. And it was fun, I get why my gf is doing what she is doing. But in hard games it's infuriating having the Pos 5 take kill after kill... What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

If you are interested, here's the game I was talking about. I'm doing these kinds of videos mostly in german btw.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk, what do you think of killstealing supports, do you think we can change something about it? Is it maybe only a mentality thing of lower MMRs? (I'm just 4k) In my opinion many people underestimate the impact of supports getting a lot of kills.... Or am I maybe just overestimating this impact?

t3_m7vbcz,Windranger Shard - Lingering Vision Nerf,"""The Powershot arrow provides 400 radius flying vision as it travels, which sticks at its final location for 3.34 seconds""

Problem: With Powershot's shard, there is no more final location!!!

.....

So, standard Powershot offers very little lingering vision through the path of the shot. It's about .2 seconds, maybe less. However, there is a decent lingering vision duration at the point of where the powershot ends, about 3 seconds. This means that if you want lingering vision in an area, you would stand at maximum of range of your powershot and fire at the location, giving 3 seconds of lingering vision at the point the powershot ends and a fraction of a second of vision along the path. This ""along the path"" vision duration is so short it gives almost no time for you to powershot and even strike a ward you wish to de-ward, when you're at point-blank range, forcing you to make max distance powershots to scout a ward on a cliff (perhaps needing a teammate to strike the ward for you).

With Windranger's shard, there is no ""end point"" to the powershot, because it goes on until it hits someone or until the map's perimeter. This seems to be an unintentional nerf to powershot's lingering vision, since now the powershot provides less utility for niche situations where you'd like to fire a max range powershot for lingering vision.

Solution: allow the aghanim's shard to extend the lingering vision of powershot ""along the path"" from the current .2 seconds to about a second or two. This should be enough time to deward a ward and is a nice buff for 1400 gold, making it a competitive choice.",DotA2

t3_m83w6k,My take on team strategy,"Hi! In this post I'd like to cover some topics related to team strategy, mostly from the perspective of teams or groups of players who play often together and have the luxury of planning team coordination.

**Positions**

 I'll start by stirring up some controversy, namely, by questioning the 1-2-3-4-5 position principle, to get people interested. This is a fine general level strategy describing internal relations within the team, and giving a template for the players on how to position themselves relative to others , such as making decisions of importance - who should try and sacrifice themselves to save an ally, if it's worthwhile to trade like your position 5 player to opponents position 3 player and so on. It also sets up this farming hierarchy. 

However a strong and strategy oriented team, there's no one forcing you to use this particular template. You can have a midlane play who also ends up getting most farmed in the game, and you can have a safelane player who doesn't farm that much but gets active early on. You could even have a position 4 that transitions to some kind of a carry. In theory anyway. 

I think for a lot of people this idea seems like just the right and the natural way of playing DOTA, the strongest style of playing, or something like that, it's so obvious and widely accepted - especially because it allows random non-team players coordinate in random pubmatches and therefore eases teamwork - that a lot of people don't even question or think about alternatives. There's nothing in the game mechanics that says that one person in the team must be the most important player, and one person must the least important player, but there's definitely logic to it.

The main driving force behind this strategy is the lane mechanics, tower positioning, and that the amount of resources on the map are fairly limited. There's only a set number of gold creeps to farm, lane creeps to farm, and if you get to decide how to distribute this gold and experience within your team, you can optimize around a scheme, such as position 5 player adopting a strategy that goes well with having less experience and less gold than other team members, and thus chooses a hero that goes well with that plan, and they can be impactful for the team. If you would have a hero that requires items to perform well, and has abilities that enhance the effect of items, but ends up not getting any gold, it would not be very optimal. So this strategy works as a template to answer questions of this sort. 

A team with a strong strategical sense in my opinion should be able to see this template as just one possible strategy, albeit a very efficient one. This could be compared to a chess opening. Like strong chess players stick to the certain openings, but sometimes deviate in order to create an unpredictable position that their opponent isn't prepared for. In other words they derive some value from doing something slightly unconventional to get the benefit of it being something their opponent hasn't considered in advance. For the very top players, so far as I understand, they have memorized lots of different openings and ways to play specific positions, and you don't want to end up playing an opening in which the opponent can memorize several variations and you don't know any of them - then you have to spend more time to figure out what to do, while your opponent can save their time by making some moves quickly, therefore gaining a time advantage as the game progresses. 

But even as these great players make unconventional moves or deviate slightly from the most popular variations, that doesn't mean they make random moves, or would accept a bad move just for the sake of doing something different. They're still looking for ideas that can work, even if when crunched by ac computer, the advantage of a move could be slightly inferior compared to the most popular move.

DOTA doesn't have that much freedom regards to these high level team division strategies, that are on the level of this 1-2-3-4-5 principle. The laning mechanics sort of give you only narrow room to wiggle in. If your team is farming all the creeps in the jungle, and all the creeps on the lanes, then you're wasting any of those limited resources. Good strategies therefore seek to fulfil this restriction - to avoid wasting any of those resources. Of course early on it's very difficult to farm all the jungle creeps, and it mostly doesn't happen that every single creep gets farmed in the early game, but as you advance towards the middle game, it's not at all uncommon that all creeps get efficiently farmed during some periods of time when there's no team fight going on.

So the lane mechanics relate then to the tower placements and the lane creep equilibriums, distance to outpost. Safelane is safe, because the lane equilibrium is closer to the tower of the side that considers it safe, and it's offlane to the other side, because the lane equilibrium is further away from their tower. In addition to that, the camps that can be pulled on the lane, sort of reside on the safelane side. Not exactly, since the medium camp is somewhat in between, but definitely the small camp with the weakest critters, is on the safe side. This means that the safelane player can basically get the last hits alone under the tower safely, and they don't have to spend so much gold on sustaining themselves and are less at a risk of getting ganked even if they try to get the maximum amount of gold. The safelane support, position 5 player then, gets a bit behind in experience as they're not always within reach to the lanecreeps, and spend time doing things like buying items for the carry, pulling the lanecreeps, and taking care of warding.. In addition to trying to harass the opposing side's players. Midlane equilbrium is very close to both side's towers, which makes the midlane rather safe, it's basically the safest place to farm. 

You could theoretically start with 2 players on the midlane, and only 1 player on the safelane. If you wanted to. But this wouldn't benefit maximally from the protection offered by the tower, and if you would have only 1 player on the safelane, his or her opponents have the choice of pulling the creeps on the lane, and if they have to try and counter that from happening, while also farming the lanecreeps they would be in a pinch. 

If you would play with 3 players on the offlane, for sake of comparison, they would get behind in terms of experience, and perhaps there would be a loss incurred on the safelane, if you would do that. 

Anyway, this is just a brief attempt to summarize what are the reasons for the players having typically 2 players on safelane and offlane, and 1 player on the midlane. Sometimes also the 4th player, support for the offlane, farms the jungle creeps. So there's a tradeoff involved, you're losing less resources that spawn in your jungle, as someone is farming them early on, but on the other hand the offlane player has to play alone, which means they're probably getting less last hits and less gold therefore, while the safelane player for the opposing team, is probably having an easier game and will be more dangerous. 

So let's get back to the basics, you as a team have decided to use this optimization scheme of distributing gained resources in a preset manner within the team. There's no one forcing you to do this. You can decide how you want to distribute the resources. You can decide that your position 5 player farms the jungle after minute 6 and gets big and fat, while the safelane carry stays on the lane. This might not work, and you can reason about it. If the safelane carry would have those resources instead and more over would be capable of farming the jungle efficiently due to items like battlefury, they might be able to put them into better use, because of their choice of hero, and so forth.

Well that's it for the controversy bit. It turns out that this analysis although I intended it to be brief, it turned worthy of it's own post. But now I'll move to the actual topics of this thread, for which this was just supposed to be a preface teaser.

**Staging maneuvers**

So when coordinating a team you can split a plan into stages like preparation step, initiation step and final step. For an example. What this means in practice though is let's imagine this following pattern:

You and your team have decided to define an attack strategy which you call plan one. For lack of better name. This plan is intended to be used after t1 towers are taken down, and it consists of these stages:

1. Your supports are getting wards, and smoke, and dust of appearance into their inventories, and then each player teleports to the outpost of your side. 

2. The team uses smoke of deceit and intends to take over the high ground of the opposing side's bounty rune spawn. One person might advance a bit before the others to try and scout the area by placing wards or dewarding, and the rest then follow on the high ground.

3. If there's fighting involved, there's some sketch of a tactic that's going to be used, like person A stuns and person B attacks the support or whatever. But point is you fight to gain control of the highground. Then you gain vision by warding the area properly, which is possible, because in the preparation step, you checked that you have required wards for this.

4. After the high ground is taken, you attack the opposing side's offlane t2 tower while maintaing control of the high ground, to make it more difficult to defend, and so the people attacking the tower, don't get jumped from the high ground. Once the tower is down, the plan ends.

So this basically describes one way of taking the offlane t2 tower from the opposing side in a way that there's these stages. So you can think about like positioning and requirements. So instead of just attacking the tower, which would be your pub match level strategy ""push tower now!"", you decide that it's better to first gain a positional advantage that allows you to accomplish your goal, which is in this case the high ground of the bounty spawn, and you have preparation step and like a rendezvous point, or the outpost, in which you check that you meet the requirements for this task, and each player is ready to start doing something.

Basically you can come up with any kind of strategy for your team, this is more like a very general template on how to break down what happens in this team tactic, by thinking about preparation and steps, and what positional advantage you're trying to get. 

**Preparing for your opponents' responses**

So the most obvious think to ask yourself next, when you've come up with some strategy that you're going to try, is to ask, well how is our opponent going to respond? If you're trying to take over an area or wards something or attack a tower, what are they going to do? Are they going give up the tower, and instead attack your tower on the other side of the map? Are they going to try and contest the area you're claiming for yourself? How are they going to do that? Are teleporting in, are they just walking up the stairs onto the high ground, do they use smoke? Is there area control spells that help gain some ground, like aoe damage spells that are persistent? This is sort of straightforward, you expect opponents to respond to your moves and maneuvers in some way, and you can try and decide in advance how you're going to deal with these different cases. 

**Strategical synergy and drafting heroes**

Some heroes have tactical synergy and they complete each other well because they have two techniques that work well together. Like Crystal Maiden casting Frost Bite, and Bloodseeker casting Blood Rite, and there's this synergy because the rooted person can't step out of the area. But this is on the tactical level, so in this section I'd like to rather discuss strategical synergy.

So strategy then is a bit broader and more general way for these heroes to complement each other, for an example if you have a lot of heroes in your team that seek to win the game early, it's probably not a great idea to pick a hero that's really bad in the early game but only gets after 40 minutes have passed. And so forth. You can think about their fighting styles and the type of advantage, which is almost getting in the area of tactics already, like for an example if you have void spirit and queen of pain, well they both have this mobility advantage and initiative advantage, as well as escape advantage, so it's not clear if the tactical similarity is a synergy or not, but it can be a strategical synergy, if your style of engagement, or strategy, is to like have very brief fights where you pick on a single hero and then retreat quickly. 

Other examples of this kind of synergy might be the ability to dominate lanes and push towers early on, so if you have heroes of this sort on each lane, then you could claim that there's some synergy with respect to pushing, like for an example let's say you have Viper, Death Prophet, Nature's Prophet, Lycan and Leshrac or something. I'm not sure if these are good examples, since the topic of lane domination was mentioned, but I think the readers know my point here. Death Prophet sort of makes defenders retreat during the duration of the exorcism, and it also damages towards, which makes it easier to gain ground and start attacking the tower. Viper can clear the lane creeps very fast early, and can also push your opponents into retreating by using the poison attack, Nature's prophet can show up anywhere next to a tower and summon cute little critters that start banging the tower down, Lycan has this shard and builds necronomicon, and buffs his minions, Leshrac has some building damaging spells. You could also try to split roles so that some heroes are good early and others later, if you see fit. Having heroes that are good in the end game might be a reasonable strategy, that also gives you a direction that you want to play to make the longer, so that means less risk taking, less commitment to highly consequential fights. 

**Assigning positional tasks to members**

Having some kind of an idea that who stays back, and who goes in first, and who tries to provide vision or things like that, can be incorporated to planning. This is also a standard schematic that players use even in pubmatches, in that you have usually like an offlane hero who is tanky and front line, and then you have heroes like sniper or drow, who want to stay back and keep their distance, and heroes like Enigma who can have a big effect on a team fight by using blink dagger and casting blackhole, whether or not you should start a fight that way I guess depends on various factors, but basically this type of hero can be one that always wants to join the fight once it has already started, when the opponent is already committed to fighting.

**To end with**

Actually the introduction got too long, and I got tired and I don't feel like writing anymore, and I think this is already a lot for anyone to read, so I'll just put the period here. Let me know what you think, and  if you have something to add. Also as a word of warning, I'm rated at only 400 MMR so this might not be such a reliable guide, although it's about team coordination rather than soloqueue anyway. I didn't mention the standard DOTA topics like split pushing and 5-man DOTA, although I was going to, but like I said I want to finish here now.

**Also looking for people to play with**

The high of dota, of those games, I hope everyone knows, nothing comes close to that. I'd take that high over the best kind of weed because that right there makes me happy. Don't get me wrong, at it's worst it can be frustrating, almost like a hostage situation, but in those times, when everything is perfect, no not the stomps or the games you own, but the games that make your heart race, palms sweat, that feeling is unparalleled.  
It is something about this game, the little interactions, the mind games, that nothing else can encompass. Dota helped me not to turn the stuff that could have ruined me, and I am quite glad for that.

Laning mid against a Huskar, things are going well - get an early kill, hit 6 first, and start bullying him out of lane. Imagine my surprise when, as I'm mid life-drain, he turns around and ultis me, and the life drain is cancelled - with Huskar obviously taking me out shortly afterwards.   


""Maybe I just cancelled it by accident"" I thought, although in the back of my mind I already know that I've got the 'requires stop to cancel' option selected. So then Huskar does it again, and  proceeds to snowball into an unstoppable blue murder machine, and take over the game.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the games are getting repetitive, since a lot of them aren't really balanced (many had factions who are clear better than others) and just have not being updated for a long time, more than 5 years to be exact. We have been using an old shared copy of Warcraft III, and we clear don't want to migrate to Reforged, and I guess anybody who understands what they did with it will understand why. 

So I recently discovered that Dota 2 have a space to make custom games as the old battlenet did, what is amazing, but I don't know if outside of aganhim lab it really worked out.

Little history : like for 1.5 hrs ago i find an unranked match with new accounts guys and 1 of them say me : ""man, there's top 600 eu against you on mid"", i said : ""okay i actually don't care about it"". Just want to tell you 1 midlane thing that describe this dude (we're stood MK (me) vs SF matchup) - this top 600 player cast 3 razes for actually 1 and half minute, after that he dies 3 times and go to the woods on 6 minutes of game (casual top 600 gameplay). Finish the game stage - we're lose this game and its actually means nothing, because i provoked him to talk about his fake top 600 eu account and his mmr binding things (below the text I attached chat and ours conversation about his accounts with translate)  


The lesson of this situation - now many dota 2 players can calibrate 7k+ accounts with this mmr bind thing and I think its not that Valve wanted to do with the boosters in dota - the highmmr players now can monetise their 7-8k accounts for mmr binding and it's destroys all ranked matchmaking system as well. Hope Valve will fix this mmr bind shit. Thanks for your attention (check the screenshots with translate)

I see a lot of posts on here mentioning boosters but i dont feel like a lot of them mention the biggest issue. Most boosters on the NA server are SA players. No NA player is going to waste 150-200 hours for a 100 dollar payout. Its players from SA that are used to making a few dollars a day that will be doing the boosting meaning that playing with your language preferences set at English is a MASSIVE disadvantage when queing. Most of the offset mmr players you will be playing with are boosted and most of the boosters will be on the opposite team.

Just curious.
I just like to know what are some of the reasons why some channels do this deletion? Is it because they do not want to look bad? For example, there was an aegis steal moment which happened to be the comeback moment to eventually winning (the comeback happened so instantly after the steal)..but it was skipped entirely. My comments on that were then perhaps deleted? Other comments appeared just fine. Certainly they skip it not because of duration given that it is the defining and deciding moment of the match, don't they?

Why would they skip?

t3_m7qnb4,Io change," hello, I want to offer my own version of changing wisp. I propose to remove his second ability and replace it with the one that I invented myself. It's no secret that Wisp is an extremely strong core hero due to the farm speed. I suggest changing the second ability so that the hero can still kill creeps, but he did it not so quickly. my idea is to make the second ability passive with a 12/10/8/6 second cooldown, which will boost the hero's next auto attack. Wisp will shoot a large ball, dealing his attack damage + his strength, the ball will scatter in a radius of 300 in all enemy creatures, splitting into normal basic attacks and healing Wisp for 5/10/15/20% of the damage dealt. if he hits 2 heroes and 3 creeps with \~ 80 damage, then he heals for 160 hp. if this is too much, then you can reduce the amount of vampirism. I believe that this will improve the hero in the amount of healing, give a little survivability and completely or almost completely remove the ability to select him in the mid.

t3_m772oc,Avoiding toxic behaviour and having fun from the game,"So, recently I have started paying attention to my mentality. It started shifting from positive to toxic, this, in my opinion, is caused by the toxic behaviour of other players. It is like a disease that affects more and more people.

There have been games after which I felt so tilted that I shouldn't have gone for the next match and just cool down a bit. This resulted in me flaming my teammates (I mostly play safelane) with the purpose to hurt them. Indeed I understood that what I was doing was wrong, but I just couldn't stop typing. 

I tried to analyze why this happened to me and the ways to stop it. 

Turns out the best way: is to turn the chat off (I only can receive messages from friends). How this affected my games and mentality? My mentality automatically switched from looking for my teammates' mistakes to focusing on my own game. This resulted in better laning, better decision making and therefore better win rate.

 I stopped tilting in the first 5 minutes of the game when my offlane picks Pudge and the whole team proceeds to accuse him of all world's sins. I just don't care, and have fun from a good ""sport"".

Without the necessity of typing useless words in chat, I had plenty of time to think about itemization and timings. Instead of wasting energy and time to prove someone is wrong, I started actually having fun.

How about communication?

As I'm a Guardian rn I don't feel I need communication, as Pings and Chat Wheels still persist. However, I'm not sure about higher brackets. 

How about chat fun?

Of course, if you will turn the chat off, you are going to miss those juicy punchlines from funny players but it happens once in 30 games, so you wont miss too much.

t3_m73m78,New Hero Concept: Mindbender 2.0,"Hey, I really enjoyed reading the feedback from my previous hero concept Goblin Mindbender and wanted to post a reworked ""2.0"" design with some new ideas and that I think works on improving a lot of the weaknesses of the previous design, and has potential for a lot stronger synergy between the abilities. Just wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to give feedback, I have a lot of fun writing these as a hobby. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Primary Stat: Intelligence
- Attack Range: 550 

&amp;nbsp; 

**Q: Punishment**
  
- Forces the target enemy unit to stand in place and attack themselves for 1/1/2/2 attacks total, applying all on-hit effects and adding magical damage equal to Mindbender's Intelligence multiplied by 1/1.25/1.25/1.5. 
- The target will be unable to perform any action until they have completed the required number of attacks, using their normal attack animation time.
- Attacks that miss will not be counted as a completed attack. 
- Targets who are unable to attack due to certain effects such as being disarmed or ethereal will have the disabling effect of Punishment paused until those effects wear off and they are able to attack again. 
- Cast Range: 500
- Mana Cost: 80/90/100/110
- Cooldown: 15/14/13/12 seconds
- Removed by basic dispels
- Blocked by magic immunity 
  
*The Mindbender's most favourite trick is to pinpoint any shred of self-loathing in his foes and develop it into more tangible violence.*

&amp;nbsp;

**W: Blackout**
  
- Conjures an area of shadows at the target location. All enemy units within the area will have their sight radius reduced to 300 and all enemy units outside the area will not be able to see inside of it, regardless of whether their allies are in the area. 
- All enemy units within the area will have their movement speed slowed by 20% and their attacks will have a 30/40/50/60% chance to miss. 
- Duration: 6/8/10/12 seconds
- Linger: 0.5 seconds
- Radius: 500
- Cast Range: 700
- Mana Cost: 120/140/160/180
- Cooldown: 25 seconds
- Slow and miss chance are blocked by magic immunity, vision restrictions are not blocked by magic immunity 
  
*Those confronted with the Mindbender often find themselves lost in a world of darkness, clutching at shadows.* 

&amp;nbsp;

**E: Parting Gift**
  
- Mindbender's basic attacks apply a stack of Doubt, which slows the target's attack speed by 8/10/12/14 for 6 seconds. 
- Doubt stacks indefinitely and each new stack refreshes the duration of all stacks, however the maximum attack speed slow that can be applied is 140. 
- When Doubt stacks expire or are dispelled or the target dies, an explosion of dark energy is released from them, dealing 15/30/45/60 magic damage for each stack to all enemy units within a 350 radius of them. 
- Illusion attacks will apply stacks of doubt. 
- Removed by basic dispels, however will trigger explosion
- Blocked by magic immunity 
  
*The Mindbender blesses all his new friends with the gift of self-doubt and apprehension. The explosive part is just for theatrics.* 

&amp;nbsp;

**Ultimate: Hostile Takeover**
  
- Mindbender channels for up to 2.5/3.5/4.5 seconds, during which Mindbender gains control of the target enemy hero. 
- While channeling, Mindbender has full control the target's movement and attacks, and can make them attack their own allies, however Mindbender cannot use the target's active abilities or active items. 
- Additionally, Mindbender cannot move the target more than 1000 units away from the initial point they were standing on ability cast, this radius will be denoted by a spectral circle on the ground. 
- While under Mindbender's control, the targets attacks gain all of Mindbender's on-hit effects, such as Parting Gift and items like Maelstrom, Desolator, Daedalus, etc. 
- Cast Range: 700
- Mana Cost: 200/300/400
- Cooldown: 100 seconds
- Not removable by dispels, only removable by interrupting the channel
- Blocked by magic immunity 
  
*Of all the Mindbender's formidable abilities, the most feared is his aptitude for sowing chaos among his enemies, turning brother against brother, friend into foe. Wherever there are backs stabbed there is a good chance the Mindbender may be at work.* 

&amp;nbsp;

**Talents:**

- Attack Range +150
- Blackout slow +15%
  
**15:**

I saw that all of them seem to be tied to past passes and loot boxes, and my question is - are they to never return and be obtainable in any way again? And on the side of passes in present and future, is progress on them only possible through PvP games or can you play co-op bots to progress?

t3_m7eew1,Why is Ranked Matchmaking Such Garbage Right Now?,"I'm in about 4.5k MMR with 9550 behavior score, NA region. Every single game I play is determined by which team either has an account buyer (or 2) who just feed and flame the entire game, or a smurf who run over my midlaner and end the game 20-0 on Void Spirit or something. Both are super easy to spot, usually less than 500 games, profile levels less than 50, and for account buyers they are usually abnormally high medal compared to the others in the game because of how rapidly their MMR is going down; i.e. a Divine 3 or so ending up in an Ancient 4 game.  


I played with an account buyer today who griefed and flamed me for buying boots on weaver. Seriously. He intentionally ruined because I. bought. boots. on. Weaver. I check profile... level 30 with only about 200 games, endless winstreak then suddenly endless loss streak. My other support, same exact thing; low level profile, hidden dotabuff, ends game 0-12. Next game: Pudge hard support player, ends the game 1-15, ruins my lane as carry and flames me all game about absolutely nonsensical stuff.  


The game quality has been like this for almost 2 months now, and it's making me hate Dota. I don't learn anything from these games, I don't have fun playing them, and for a game that's supposed to be competitive it's pretty dumb to lose or win solely based on whether you have account buyers that are going to be deadweight if not outright throw, or, albeit more rarely, a smurf who's going to 1v5 the game for either team.  


It's just nuts to me that the game is already 10 years old or so and account buying is still this prevalent; I'd go as far as to say it's the issue most plagueing the game at the moment.  


I don't know about you guys but I think I'm taking a break from Dota until the game quality and account buyer issue gets sorted out because I've gotten more stress from the game as a result than I've gotten enjoyment and I know I'm not the only one.",DotA2

Personally I think it has become such a ubiquitous item in the game that it reminds me slightly of Stout shield (before it was removed) where almost every core was buying it.

Which meta developments would result? which heroes would become weak and which would benefit?

Personally I think it would create very big ripples through the game - adversely affecting mid heroes like storm, puck, void spirit, ember etc. the most. Ganking would become harder to sustain, thereby encouraging mids to stay and farm, and therefore mids would become more of the carry, pushing safe lane cores to become more active to compensate.

t3_m78icd,A take on hero itemization,"Hello! In this thread I'd like to write my take on how to itemize heroes and how to make build decisions depending on matchup. 

**Team composition analysis**

Analyze both sides of the match, start from paying attention what heroes have been picked. 

Assess the ratio of different types of damage: Is the opposing team doing a lot of physical, magical or pure damage? 

Assign weight to each damage type: Are the carries all right clickers? 

**Itemization for farming** 

What are the contexts in which you will be farming in with your given position and hero choice? Do you farm the jungle, do you push the lanes? How much farming will you be doing in this game? 

DOTA is a bit unusual in the genre of PvP games and PvP oriented multiplayer rpg style games, in that the encounters involve farming. Each match consists of choosing your build and funding it with gold. This means items can not be chosen solely on the basis of what will be good when fighting with your opponents, but you will have to take into account what impact they have for your income. 

For an example: Hand of Midas has an obvious investment property. You can use the ability every 90 seconds and it gives you 160 gold and some extra experience (Although you may want to deduct some of the gold you would get if you were to farm the creep in question using traditional means), but to get this item you have to pay a 1750 gold recipe cost that grants you a bonus of 20 attack speed and this ability. There is an opportunity cost involved, the most obvious point of comparison being Hyperstone, which costs 2000 gold and grants you 60 attackspeed, versus 40 attackspeed for 2200 gold spent on the Hand of Midas, so in effect you're losing in this tradeoff 200 gold and 20 attackspeed, but gaining 160 gold income at an approximate interval of 90 to 120 seconds, which increases your gold per minute by +80 to +106 gpm. In 10 minutes you would therefore gain approximately 800 gold to 1060 gold. If you sell the item, you get only 50% of the value back, giving you a loss of 1100 gold, which means with plans to sell the item later, you've to use it for at least 10 minutes for it to be worthwhile. On the other hand if you plan to keep it, the 20 attack speed and 200 gold loss is fairly easy to cover. There are more functional items you could consider in this tradeoff, like glimmercape, forcestaff, blademail and so on. Hyperstone is kind of plain stats item until you use it to build another item, so keep in mind that there's a lot more to this tradeoff than this numerical 20, 200 point.  So you're losing some strength, which might be costly, if you were to gain on average more gold by using blademail instead, for an example, but you will be compensated by strength later due to the extra income. All the items have these kinds of investment property considerations that go into them. Survivability during gank attempts has somekind of value that could be attempted to measure in gold, and so on.

**Laning stage itemization**

During the laning stage when you're competing with your opponents about last hits, having higher damage helps get last hits. Because you're not only competing with your opponents who are trying to deny, but with your own creeps and potentially your own tower as well. If you're doing proportionally a lot more damage than your creeps and your tower, it's much easier to secure a last hit. This is most often noticed when you play supports and your carry leaves the lane. You might have trouble securing last hits under the tower, when you're doing too little damage in comparison to the tower. Note that this also involves an aspect of congruence, but as a generalization, the damage ratio is important when it comes to competing with last hits. Additional damage also helps denying in the inverse way, if you've a higher damage than your opponents who are trying to get last hits, it's easier for you to deny the creeps. 

So the main point of the laning stage is to get last hits, and prevent your opponent from getting them. Everything else sort revolves around this goal. For an example, if you're to pressure an opponent, they'll have to retreat. It's unlikely you can gank someone who is trying to just runaway, but they're trying to maintain their presence on the lane, in order to get last hits, and to deny your last hits, so they want to stretch their survivability against the risk of being ganked. 

Potential to take down your opponent, and to get away from takedown attempts is then the next point. If both sides are just last hitting and denying, simply having damage items is nice, but they're not, they're also attacking and harassing the other side, and looking for opportunities to take down their opponents. Movement speed helps avoid being taken down, armor reduces damage intake, armor reduction increases your damage on your opponents, orb of corrosion has some kind of an impact on pressure, because the opponent will not be able to run away as easily, they'll have to leave slightly earlier, in some cases, missing on last hits.

Sustain items are basically the last and the 3rd major point, to reiterate, you want to get last hits and deny, and prevent your opponents from doing the same. You want to have pressure of gank potential on them, to make it harder to get last hits, and have enough survivability and escape potential, so that you can keep last hitting and denying. Sustain then allows keeping your health and mana up, so you can use your abilities. 

Magic stick is one of the most obvious items, it's usefulness is proportional to the ability use rate of your opponents. If your opponents use abilities frequently, it makes the magic stick better. If they just right click, it does nothing. Almost all heroes do something, but keep in mind there's variance between different heroes in this respect. Checking for an example the cooldowns and manacosts of the abilities your opponents have, is a cue to how beneficial it's going to be. The second point is, that the magic stick is not the ideal source of health sustain, or just mana sustain, but it comes with both. If you won't be benefitting from the mana, you're probably choosing the wrong item. 

**Functional and utility items**

During the later stages of the game you'll be using utility items, such as blink dagger, glimmer cape, diffusal blade, rod of atos, no need to list them all here. Items that do something other than just   
 increasing your stats passively. 

Abstract the purpose of the item. Take a step back and think about what is the goal this item achieves. Here are some examples:

\- Securing a takedown. You've a chance to fight with someone who is going to lose. How do you make sure they don't get away?

\- Making your own escape. The same sort of thing, but in reverse. How do you get away?

\- Providing initiative. For some heroes it's important that you get to make the first move, if the opponent makes the first move, it has a big impact on your performance. 

\- Preventing your opponent from doing something specific, i.e. disabling them.

\- Disjointing spells

etc.

Imagine yourself in some situation that occurs during the game, and consider yourself having this item. You're getting attacked by opposing teams skywrath mage: Maybe in this situation you'd want to activate glimmer cape? Or something else? Imagine yourself getting a jump on a hero. Which item will be most beneficial, other than just increasing your stats?

**Strategy and playstyle**

Itemization does not happen in a vacuum, but it also has some strategical implications. What is your playstyle with your hero? Are you trying to get a jump on your opponents and burst them down quickly? Are you trying to get close to your opponents? Are you trying to keep your distance from them? Do you want the fight to be quick, or do you want it to be prolonged? Are you primarily thinking about full team fights, or more like lone picking attempts? Is your advantage going to be in the late game, or in the early game? Are you going to push towers down quickly?

Some items are more beneficial the longer the fight is, and others have more of a constant value that doesn't grow a lot even if the fight gets prolonged. For an example, Aeon disk activates once, and has a long cool down. It also prolongs the fight, so it's a bit controversial. Diffusal blade makes your opponent run out of mana in the long term, but it also has a slow that acts in the short term. Orchid of Malevolence amplifies the damage someone takes during a time window of 5 seconds. And so on.

If you want to try and keep your distance from your opponent, how are you going to do it? Disengage with shadowblade? Have lots of movement speed and run away easily from approaching opponents? Or are you trying get close and get the initiative? Shadowblade? Blink dagger? Shadowblade allows you to get initiative just like blink dagger, but it's slightly less reliable, because opponent could have a ward and see you approaching. Blink dagger on the other hand, doesn't allow you to disengage, if you're already taking damage. Take into consideration these different functions. Shadowblade provides survivability and the ability to  disengage, as well as some initiative. 

**Countering opponents item choices**

There are some interactions between item choices you can make and your opponents can make, like Nullifier, Ghost Scepter, Butterfly, Monkey King Bar, Heart of Tarrasque, Eye of Skadi. A typical example would be that if your opposing team has lots of strength heroes who build hearts of tarrasque, and you're building your support, maybe you want to get Spirit Vessel? Or if you're playing carry, maybe you want to get Eye of Skadi, or even Shiva's Guard? Is your opponent building Satanic? Linken's sphere?

**Damage output and survivability optimization**

Choosing simple damage output items with no consideration for functionality, we're entering the realm of optimization, which I think is taught in High school and called ""linear optimization"". It involves two dependent variables, which work together to produce some kind of value, and you want to optimize the distribution of these two variables, to achieve something like maximizing the result value, or minimizing it. These could be something like the relationship between potatoes sold, and the cost of potatoes versus how much you paid for them. In DOTA this is basically considering whether you want attack speed or damage, and it's somewhat akin to choosing the length of two sides of a rectangle, and trying to maximize the area. Usually this is a square, but sometimes the length of the sides have a different cost, and the ratio can change. If you have a high attackspeed, you typically gain some extra value from extra damage, and vice versa. This optimization scheme is then extended to armor reduction, so now you've 3 choices and you want to maximize the volume of a cube. What is the 3D rectangle called when it's not a cube? I don't remember for some reason. Anyway. If you have very high damage and attackspeed, then you probably benefit relatively more from armor reduction, and so on. 

On the flipside of the coin, you can consider your survival time as part of the equation. If you're simply standing toe to toe with your opponents hero, no one is going to run away or use abilities, and you're in this laboratory fight, well now your survival time enters the equation. If your opponent can deal some constant rate of damage, and you want to decide how long you're going to survive, and you're choosing between health and armor reduction.. Well now you need to optimize this 4D rectangle, whatever that's called... Oh and then there's armor for yourself. It's not as complicated as it sounds, and I'm sure the readers understand what the point is.

Of course real fighting in DOTA isn't a laboratory fight that takes place in a vacuum where no one uses abilities and nothing complicated happens. So you probably need to pay attention to what's the value of activating shadowblade and running away, versus getting 2 platemails into your inventory, instead of simply considering this optimization scheme. But you should be aware of that this optimization is something to consider. Some heroes have naturally high attackspeed due to abilities, and others deal extra damage. Some heroes get armor reduction abilities for free, and so on. And as already alluded to  in the earlier sections, you've to take into account your strategy. Are you trying to prolong the fight? Make it shorter? Obviously taking damage items makes the fight shorter, compared to taking defensive items, which due to opportunity cost make you deal less damage to your opponent, and it'll take them a longer time to defeat you.

**That's it for this brief guide**

As a word of warning I'm rated at like 200 MMR or something. I'm probably 400 MMR actually, but anyway, at the bottom of the barrel. So perhaps you shouldn't read this guide without some caution. But this kind of reasoning has been successful in other contexts and I suspect it should work in DOTA as well. You go and find out.

I've also recently experimented on streaming on twitch. I'm not using a microphone or a camera, and I basically have it running almost all the time. I have enabled fullscreen mode, so you see me writing this thread, if you're watching it right now. Except for the no camera part, that is. But you can check what it is that I'm doing by visiting the stream. Unfortunately it doesn't have a notification when someone writes in the chat, and I often miss when that happens. But I'll try and check every now and then. The URL is:

Played a little bit of smite, hots. I played league since season 5 and I was high diamond since season 8. I despise game for many reasons especially no skill or strategy involved in game. Since I am pretty high on the leader 1%-0% the game is very easy unfortunently someone can just pick better character than you and you can be 10 times better than that player he still can demolish you so the only thing you can do is suck your dick under the tower until mid game have same cs as him 0 deaths but your team gets dicked it feels just like a waste of time for no reason so i was thinking what are pros to dota cuz it seems interesting and i want to learn new heroes etc. and more complicated mechanics.

UPDATE: I decided to start dota 2 i have only 1 question from league i was a mid main for 5 years now and im probably gonna continue in dota 2 the questio is: is mid 1v1 lane as in league because i saw there are no junglers also are assasins played mid or is that only mage lane. So i can see which role should i focus on i love mid but i preffer assasins overall in every game.",DotA2

I honestly don't care that I lost that game, I had fun doing exactly what I wanted to do with the hero. Honestly, I'd rather lose a game where I got to do my thing rather than win a game where I was carried and did nothing.

t3_m758um,PL is pretty much uncountered right now in Divine/Immortal bracket,"Most peoply doesn't realieze that you don't have to directly change a hero to give him/her a nerf or buff.

For an example, Spectre nerf --&gt; Arc Warden and Tinker is buffed indirectly.So in this case Sven nerfed to the trashbin --&gt; PL is really really happy. Therefore PL pickrate doubles since last patch and winrate raise to roughly 53%. For the comparision sven was broken when he had 50% winrate in divine/immortal bracket back then.And his talent is so damn good. Level 10 talent with +16% evasion, counter most battle fury meta heroes right now. And think about it the tailsman of evasion cost 1.4k gold and it gives only 15%. A level talent 10 far better than a 1.4k item. If you disagree with PL being broken tell me a hero with better level 10 talent. PA level 10 talent gives 150hp that's a fucking fluffy hat that costs250 gold.  And on top of that  in comparision Lifestealer need a fucking level 20 talent for that.Even the broken Sven needed level 15 for the dispel talent (1400 gold for aghanim shard).

Late game is the most cancerous. When it's late game his talent allow him to spam W every 6 second for almost no mana cost 50 mana and it dispel and dodge most of the shits throw at him to locate the real hero. He can even cast it while being rooted. While his illusion scales with hp and even able to tanks 2 Aoe spell with 300 damages. To give you an idea most heroes barely get 1 aoe spell. When PL get his HoT it's basically over for the enemy team. 70-100 hp regen untouchable, 50 mana spell with 6 s cooldown that allows him to join the fight, with diffusual blade he can burn out the enemy carry mana and hp in 2-3 second with his illusions only. His E allows him to be unkiteable, i mean 4 sec cd with 1150 range that's almost a blink dagger range so yes you can't blink away for force staff away.

So please PL need some changes.

Forgot to mention, The Riki nerf is also a factor that makes PL strong right now.

t3_m69me8,Just got to immortal playing only supports... Looking forward to help you.,"Hey guys, after wandering around 4k for my entire dota time I've managed to get immortal in few months playing only support. I know some of you are looking to get there, and I'm aware there's a lot of threads like that, so I'll try to list few things that I've not seen that often.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://i.imgur.com/zc6yTzH.png](https://i.imgur.com/zc6yTzH.png)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Give your teammates a good game. That's the most important tip. It sounds actually so obvious, but it's actually not. Find out who is your win condition and play around it. Got an alch in team? Stack for him. Got a spirit/puck/sf? Secure runes. Buy salves for your carry.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Mental attitude + chatwheel. First of all, you gotta try to win at all cost, but this is obvious. You will meet ragers in your team, people who get tilted coz you took a lasthit. First of all, work on your chatwheel. Put ""sorry"" in there, remove ""well played!"", put some voicelines to tilt enemies when you kill them. Do not say a negative word, never get emotional. If you find somebody who just doesnt want to win, try to say few positive words to him, mute him after and tell your teammates to do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Can't win them all. Keep 60% winrate and you're good. Do not get angry when you get close and then you lose a game. I've been 2 games away from immortal two months ago and then went on to lose around 800 mmr next two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Watch content. The best one that I can suggest is... **Jenkins**. His vids are short, are centered around meta and are actually very helpful. SVG smoke is one of the things i've used a lot in the climb. Others are: **bsj**, **1437,  ZQuixotix** (support player, his vids are really long but if you got a lot of time there's some content you can watch and improve with). And **Dubu**. If you got to a point where you're 4.5k+ mmr his vids are actually eye opening.

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutouts:

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutout to  **ZQuixotix**  and **Lazyjinn** for the replay analysis they did for me, both helped me a lot during the climb and I suggest to everyone to check their twitch channels!

&amp;#x200B;

Last point, I'm looking forward to help you guys! I can watch your replays for free, if you're a support player and looking to improve pm me  a game ID, few words about the game, what you want me to focus on and I'll try to watch it for you. Cheers!",DotA2

t3_m6lpjv,I don't understand this game.,"Alright so I have around 1000 hours on league and the game is just not that fun anymore yet I really like MOBA's in general. I thought I would try my shot with Dota2 cause it looks like a really good game but after a couple matches and doing the tutorial I am just very confused. In League as most of you might know there is a lot of structure to every game. You are given a role and you know where to go and what to do depending on your role. So when i tried Dota and I jumped into a game, everyone picked a character and didn't call a lane or role out. I watched some videos but they just left me even more confused. It seems like the roles are aren't so concrete as they are in LOL and just a general guideline to how to assist your team. Could someone guide me in the right direction or just link a good guide. THank you, it would really help.",DotA2
t3_m6sdhp,need some advices about solo offlaning,"I feel like I'm not making the right decisions when my dummy pudge/mirana picker teammates fuck off the lane.

This isn't a whining post. I do not win when I cry about having a pos4 pudge. It's a hard to swallow pill and should be accepted in order to move forward.

What do I do alone at offlane when my hero isn't underlord or tidehunter? I pick sand king most of the time and I feel like I shouldn't be failing so hard in my laning session. Most of the time I go to jungle in order to not feed the enemy carry (which has a cm back up with 2 sentries and 3 dusts) and not having the same creep score for 2 minute periods but I feel like this isn't what I'm supposed to do. I do not say this because I get flamed so hard afterwards. I want to improve.

t3_m6s00y,Ranked Re/Calibration is Cancer,"So I get into a game where I know already its going to be a stomp. 

The enemy team has a Rhasta mid, DP as the offlane, Mars pos 4, WR pos 5 supporting a MK pos 1. 

Game ends as you can imagine it, everyone on the enemy team plays like crap with their DP offlane doing the best at 5-9-0. 

The mid Rhasta goes 1-12-1, so I decided to check out the Dotabuff... 

Has 400 total games, is a Legend 2, the last time they played Rhasta was 1 month ago and went 0-12-0.

So here’s my gripe, first who thinks it’s a good idea to play a hero you have little to no experience on mid, especially when the last time you played it went 0-12-0.

Next, it kind of pisses me off that these players make these new accounts and have the same rank as me when it’s pretty clear they don’t belong at this MMR.

Like, I work my ass off to get where I’m at, and they make a new account, shit on some new players and boom couple hundred games later they are the same rank as you. 

I’m against smurfing, but, if there’s one thing that makes me want to “smurf/make a new account” it’s the fact that the current matchmaking feels broken especially the re-calibration.

Because it’s much harder to advance, especially as a support, then it is to make a new account and calibrate into a high skill and very high skill game.",DotA2

t3_m5wo06,How to DEFEND yourself against Script/Hack Lag input abuse (massive freezing/lag and unable to act).,"Greetings to everybody from Italy, I hope you all doing well.  

**Now before I start off, if you just want to know how to protect yourself from the hack go to the JUICY part in the middle of the post with the listings if you are not interested in reading the backstory and etc.**

     


Now, a little backstory of this hack, I've reviewed many overwatch cases before and found only 1-2 of cases where I saw first hand this strange lag/freeze lag where enemies or everybody would simply just freeze or would not even be able to click to move even though you would see their cursor trying to click or do something when frozen. The suspected hacker or script user would play normally throught the game but eventually he/she would stay in the back during fights or have strange camera movement and sometimes weird auto aim with mouse-moving-robotic like way  but you mostly suspect this on people who auto cast spells/items like the most known skywrath script users. However this was something I didn't see in the past, it took me several minutes rewinding over and over to see in slow motion what was going on. I had to google and look older videos or reddit posts or even just articles about scripts/hacks to understand if this was done in the past but there wasn't ANY information of this specific hack of freeze hack before until recently. 

Now today in Europe time early around 4:00-6:00 AM, I was  unlucky to find myself against such script/hack abuser TWICE in the (Immortal/Divine bracket), the player with said hack/script was uncalibrated with low amount of games and a private profile, most likely queuing in this specific hour on purpose and most likely boosting the account. 

Regardless, we were let known at the start of the match by the Rubick player in my team ""nevermoredota2"" that the player with ""&lt; Blank &gt; "" name (Bristleback) was script/hacking by lagging/freezing players in game and that he just played against him before the match where he experienced this. Sadly enough we did find ourselves unable to do much and we lost, we experienced the same lags and freezing throught the match, and a very rude enemy Earthspirit all chatting. 

The game didn't feel like a game so I queued after 10 minutes and found myself against the same player who was abusing this script/hack.

Now the difference we had this game is we had one of the enemy player from the previous game in our team (Abaddon)""griffoN."", he said that the lion was using the console to write or type as if it was him in the previous game and doing weird things, he adviced everybody to DISCONNECT and reconnect as soon as the freeze or lags would happen throught the match and IT WORKED. I still don't fully understand how exactly the whole process works but somehow disconnecting and reconnecting during these moments would recover the ability to move and click again for your allies, and for you it would allow to make your hero move back to fountain when you dc when you couldn't click away from danger instead of standing there unable to do anything which happened several times for everyone in the map. The script/hack person has a small friend list of 6 which contains a friend of his that has a twitch russian dota/csgo player. Wether they are related or know anything about this script/hack or each other or is the same person is unknown to me maybe they are just completely unrelated and its just my speculation.  

**JUICY PART**  
**So in summary if you encounter this specific type of hack/script you must:**  

- Disconnect and reconnect to the game or you will be ""targetable"" by the freeze. Do this when is most convenient.  
- The script user HAS to disconnect and reconnect to be able to ""freeze"" again if your team followed the previous advice, he will do this to ""restart"" his script. He won't dc if nobody in the enemy team he is against doesn't disconnect and will keep ""freezing"" normally throught the match.  
- If your ally is ""frozen"", YOU can disconnect from the game and he/they will regain control of their heroes again, very useful when you are on the other side of the map or when you are in a safe area watching a team fight (not garanteed to work always).  
- You will need to occasionally disconnect and reconnect throught the match as the hacker/scripter will restart his hack by disconnecting and reconnecting, this is slightly annoying/inconvenient and overtime you will lose some of your 5 minutes before abandon timing, if your computer is slow or not very good you will take more time to reconnect than others so use this wisely according to your setup.  
- The lag/freeze will be redirected to the hacker's own team if you disconnect during this process, sometimes causing the hacker himself to disconect when you do so.  
- A way to identify someone (not who specifically) with this script/hack is when a person from the scripter's team will dc (not the scripter himself) and reconnect usually done before the horn or very early own, wether it is requested to do so by the scripter or the person specific is lagging is unknown to me.    


Down below I will be linking the matches of the dotabuff, you can download the replay and review and see the script for yourself.

(My first match(Silencer) against the Hacker/scripter Bristleback)
https://www.dotabuff.com/matches/5888012247
(My second match(Hoodwink) against the Hacker/scripter Lion)

In additional notes, I noticed weird camera angle movements or moments from the hacker/scripter's perspective from replay, mouse cursor in weird areas and sometimes he would just do weird things with cursor, was able to select my hero to see inventory even though he had his camera in a completely different area (zoom hack?), maybe or unsure wether he had ward/sentry script location but it isnt as big concerned compared to the main lag/freeze problem. Hacker/Scripter wasn't a very good player.

I decided to make this post in in my hopes of letting people know how to defend against themselves this kind of attack, it appears this hack is starting to appear more and more frequently and I've seen a couple of posts in reddit dota about it, and I hope this brings some light to Valve in hopes to do something about it. I would probably just saved this to myself and not bothered in posting but I been thinking about it all day.

If the Aoe effect also affected Item Auras as well as Spell Auras then several other heroes would go for it as well, as it would buff Utility items as well.

t3_m6w2ow,Any tips to progress from legend to ancient?,"Hi guys!

Wonder to ask for a piece of advice from the community. 

I have mid legend rank and I play occasionally, mostly alone as my lower bracket friends don't want to play ranked matchmaking. I enjoy playing supports (4pos , sometimes 5pos), but feel not so much progress last a half of year (+-300-400 MMR between 3000 and 3500). As you can see from my dotabuff profile I don't play many heroes, especially cores. My goal is to just enjoy the game and have progress without overinvesting time (play 1-2 hours on weekdays, maybe some more at weekends).

My guess that progress is limited due to overall understanding of Dota. I know how to play pos4, and can do it mechanically well with my core heroes (mirana, clock, phoenix), but I do know a little about balance of power throughout different game stages for some heroes (e.g. WK is good in midgame, but what about arc, void spirit, invo etc.), because I've never played them by myself. Of course it's on top of toxic ruiners and smurfs in all 1/3 of our games.

I've heard that to become better support you need to play cores from time to time, but is it really the best way to progress? I find it a rather time-consuming approach to learn playing new heroes especially complex ones, so maybe someone could recommend some educational content or other useful tips to understand the game better?

I made a post about heroes which are unstoppable against you, but terrible in your team, and I got a lot of comments about OD making obsolete builds. Now, I don't get the ODs with bad builds, because I'm spamming OD all the time. But I do get it a lot with Enigma and Luna.

The last game I had with Enigma, he rushed an Orchid, yes, before blink and boots, he was naked with an Orchid. ""Now, this could be useful against magical heroes like Invoker"", you might say. But he spent the entire game focusing Kunkka, doing : Orchid Kunkka - midnight pulse - blackhole on Kunkka alone. So, okay, everyone gets bad players, Enigma failing their blackholes, but what's with the Orchid ? Why does he seem to think that it helps so much he needs to rush it ?

I'm asking this because I got it several times with the Orchid. A Batrider in my team rushed Orchid right after brown boots, and what he would do was just using Orchid every time he sees an enemy, and that's it, nothing else. It felt a bit like :

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o0urrxa0cin61.jpg?width=326&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be60960c399b8b190bf4149705cbc30cca65a3c4

I also got a PA rushing Orchid after her boots, so she would use her BKB, Orchid the enemy Lion and jump on him, all at the same time. It wasn't a choice to make Lion unable to use his skill when your BKB is down. And they don't go for the bloodthorn either, so it's not about dps. Somehow, it seems that they think ""Ooh, an item that amplifies 30% of the damage I dealt during 5 seconds, that should undoubtedly result in my enemies' death."". The weird thing is that apart from the Orchid, they make the correct items, but all their plays revolve around the use of the Orchid, which doesn't make sense.

Now, Luna. I get a lot of Luna going for the old 100% physical build, and while I'm not sure if it is legit or not, they always end up in something like 2/7/0, even though they're [fully farmed](https://i.ibb.co/KVzs4JZ/2dqf75pz.jpg). They make skadi-butterfly-daedalus-manta in that order and they practically never use Eclipse. I see their ultimate only 3 times in the game, and each time, it's used with a ton of creeps around. It's as if they're thinking ""Well, I am a right-click physical hero, I don't need to bother with this magical ultimate."". There's a reason why an ultimate is called an ultimate, it's because it's the ultimate ability of your hero. Yet, many people seem to think that it's useless to play with that, so they'd throw in a few blackholes and eclipses here and there in the game, without any resolve.

So, do you get other heroes on which this happens consistently ?

Maybe it comes from a Youtube trend that I'm not following, I could be the one out of touch.

So I've been dealing with this weird pattern in my DotA 2 games which has been preventing me to rank up. I used to be 5.6k but then I got deservedly banned (just the acc). I went back to my 4k account (my very first acc) and started winning games until the games became way too unbalanced for me and I lost around 700 MMR.

Currently, my games are either too hard to win or a complete stomp. No easy/comfortable games at all. My teammates and usually 2-3 of the players in the enemy team are not very skilled but there's always one or two fed very high skill players in the enemy team.

t3_m6ggq3,Help getting out of herald !!,"How to get out of Herald Rank

Hi there,
So I’m fairly new to Dota I think, compared to my friends who have been playing for 4+ years I’ve only been playing for almost 1. I calibrated my rank and lost them all, maybe because I played with my friends who were higher ranks than me so I went against harder people?
But I think better than herald, considering this is the first moba game I’ve ever played. I’ve played around 700 games but only recently got into ranked. I tend to play games with at least one of my friends because I don’t like to communicate on voice chat with my team (I’m a girl and feel if I do bad they tend to say it’s because I’m a girl) and don’t have time to stay still and type out shit. I was wondering does anyone have any tips for getting out of herald? I tend to play safelane carry a lot and usually farm my first item then a BKB before I join fights but then I feel bad that my team is fighting without me. Should I go and help them or ?
I’ve played 56 ranked games with a 55% win rate which I thought would get me out of herald at least. 
Not too sure if this’ll help to provide me with constructive criticism but heres my dotabuff profile: https://www.dotabuff.com/players/474767620

Feel free to be as mean as possible lol, I’d love to get some feedback on what I can do to get out of this bracket. 😊",DotA2

I know that the game won't really die. But my point is that there are lesser people playing the game. These are the players I have added after a Dota 2 match. And I even have deleted more not so long ago because of inactivity. I guess I have deleted around 100 already. And some of these players on my list who logged in did not even play Dota 2. They could just have logged in randomly or played another game. How does your list go?

I just can't myself playing another game. But it saddens me that the quality of games starts to decline quickly. I don't really mind playing against smurfs or boosters. But there are lesser players who could have lower MMRs but could still stand toe to toe with smurfs and boosters. Long ago, I have played with good players and I added them to my list. But after a few years when medals were introduced, some of them were already higher Ancients, and some of them were just lower Crusaders. There were even one or two Heralds and a few Guardians. I am a stable mid to lower Legend. But I have reached my highest at 4,100.

t3_m5ut4f,Opinion on Mobility Power Creep?,"What are peoples opinion on mobility creep in dota? The last few patches greatly improved hero mobilty, whether through items such as swift blink and abyssal blade, talents or shard/scepter upgrades. The movespeed cap barely matters anymore as every hero can theoretically surpass the movespeed cap. Then you have heroes with dashes/blink abilities which now have talents/aghs upgrades which can allow them to travel huge distances of the map in a very short time. Most mobile heroes have talents/shard/scepter upgrades to heavily improve their mobility and other movement options such as boots of travel. abyssal blade and swift blink.

I think the worse offenders are io, riki, windranger, broodmother, morphling and ember spirit. Honourable mentions to Anti-Mage, Alchemist (swift blink turns him into a 600+ MS raid boss, no problems here) and Juggernaut (swift blink + aghs shard and scepter, gl hf bro). All these heroes traverse the map at extreme speed provided they have the correct items + talents and all of them have some built in ""save"", whether its through healing, invunerability of defensive utility through dispels or counterspell etc.

In their default form most mobility spells are balanced however, the combination of new items, scepter and shard upgrades along with talents make alot of moblie heroes impossible to deal with after a certain stage of the game. You can't really position agaisnt these heroes, you just better hope they can't kill you when they jump you.  its very difficult to deal with these heroes when they get shard/scepter/talents.

I think the immobile glass cannon DPS hero is a dead archetype in the current version of dota (Drow, Zeus, Lina, Sniper etc). There are too many heroes which can gap close from the other side of the map. 

While having absurd mobility is very fun to play, it can become nearly impossible to deal with after a certain point in the game. Maybe im wrong though, there is enough CC in the game to successfully chain stun somebody to their death.",DotA2

t3_m6g8p0,Nudge towards good plays,"I have been playing this game since dota 1, so close to 15 FIFTEEN years, reaching 4.5k in the process. Since I started following BSJ, I now realize I have been playing an entirely different game from good dota. Some very basic suggestions helped me a lot (list below), so I find it crazy that we don't use our tools in game to nudge people towards the correct behavior. 

Let me list some concepts I learned from bsj and some ideas on how these might be implemented.

1.	Knowing the correct order of objectives: their safe lane T1, then a side T2, then Rosh, then mid T2, then HG. People in my bracket don't do this well and when I play with friends in the 3k bracket, games are SUPER long because nobody ever takes objectives. Like... Everyone spends 20 min every game in the jungle.
2.	Knowing that after the laning stage my side of the map includes not my jungle but the enemy's, ie the map is split in half not by the river but by the mid lane! This concept is also connected to the dead lane.
3.	Knowing that you should push lanes in before doing rosh. You think it's fucking obvious and it is, but dota is all about making the right decision in real time, which means that we all get it wrong most of the time. In a recent coaching [session](https://youtu.be/v8PjwRvsyWs), these guys don't do it at 5.5k which is far better than &gt;99% of dota players  
4.	In general, knowing which parts of any jungle are safe by looking at the two surrounding creep waves. BOOM, how did I not think of that in 15 fucking years man. Saved me so many deaths.

This is 2021, we are not limited by WC3 Dota anymore and we could just bake some of these into the game for everyone to improve. Here's some examples of how we could help with each of the points above.

1.	We could literally place a big ass target icon on the next recommended target. It doesn't prevent you from ignoring it and doing whatever you want, but will help low-MMR dota *a ton* because people will naturally want to play in that area more. We could also show the enemy's next objective as well, as it helps with defenses. It will also act as a Roshan reminder whenever that is the enemy's objective.
2.	We need some clues here, either in the actual map or in the minimap. Something simple could do: after Min 10, change the top lane colors to be like Radiant and the bottom lane to be like Dire. As towers fall, we could extend this map change to give a strong visual clue to players about it. If this isn't doable, then maybe just mark it on the minimap somehow.
3.	Make rosh red until surrounding /r/lanes are pushed out. Again, you could just ignore it (and feed), but it nudges you.
4.	Change the theme of the jungle (radiant/dire) based on surrounding lanes. Make people want to shove lanes by having the map dynamically change to your color the more you shove.

There are certainly ways to make this stuff suble and non-intrusive but just like we have nudges for common ward spots, why not have nudges for good dota? Also, Valve just fucking hire BSJ and work on this shit with him? How hard can this be? This would also help new players A LOT, as they will now have a general idea of what to do! Very important after the Netflix series.",DotA2
t3_m5z84l,[QOL Suggestion] Make Astral Spirit Vector-targettable on Elder Titan,"As an ET main, it's such a clunky experience to spawn use Spirit:

1. Cast the ability
2. Wait for the cast animation to end (cause if you try to select it before it spawns, you might end up moving your own hero or stomping where you are)
3. Select the spirit
4. Issue a move command 
5. Re-select your hero

If we give the option to click and drag, to spawn the spirit and make it run in that direction automatically, **it will reduce the process from 5 actions to 1 action.**

You can still cast normally without dragging, which won't issue a move command by default.

You can increase the amount of gold by buying Midas, and stacking, since support would get extra gold ""out of nothing"" for stacks farmed by carry.

You can reduce enemy's farm/map control by taking towers and capturing their part of the map.

Picking 5 carries isn't an option, strictly economically, there's not enough resources for five-man-farming!!!

I don't know how else to explain that to people. I just had a game where i was the carry and my Offlane picked Ark Warden,Soft Support - Techies, and he went skipping a lane with mines, wasn't even bothered by me farming creeps(you know how they do it) or forming my farming pattern in particular direction, and Arc Warden, how naive of me was to think that he'd play active dota, no, he went straight to the triangle+farming one lane+sending clone to farm other places.

Final results are fascinating, i've won my lane but after 10 min mark i have almost no increase in farming, being carry. Our 3 cores had 75k gold, while enemy Mid+Carry had 70k, none of our two cores could kill their one core and on top of that we had 20k in Techies with Linken's and Bloodthorn(10k spent wisely). 50 min game where PL loses lane, dies a couple of times to the mines, hits creeps for 25 min and then wins all the team fights, god how much i love these games.",DotA2

* ~~You need at least 6k behaviour score, 1k MMR and play at least 1 match/day in the last week to be able to review cases (even co-op bot matches work).~~
* Don't click anywhere once you click on the `Download replay` button. If you misclick somewhere and the replay bugs out, go to `steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\replays` and delete the replay there. Then try again.
* You can check the number of reviewed cases and successful convictions [here](https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/570?category=Account&amp;tab=OverwatchAccountStatus) (this has been posted on the sub few times before).
* However, this is actually not an indicator of the total number of cases you have reviewed. You can see a full list of all the cases you reviewed [here](https://steamcommunity.com/my/gcpd/570?category=Account&amp;tab=OverwatchMatchReviewer).

   * 2 = Insufficient evidence
   * 3 = Guilty
* The time shown on this page is in Unix time. You can convert it to readable time using [this site](https://www.epochconverter.com/).
* **Insufficient evidence counts towards guilty verdicts.** If you're not sure when reviewing the case and mark insufficient evidence, but enough people mark guilty, your verdict will contribute to the player getting convicted.
* You can look at the first link and see that the `NumReviewedCases` value is equal to the number of insufficient evidence verdicts + number of guilty verdicts. This likely also includes cases where the player was punished but you gave a not guilty verdict.
* The ratio between `NumReviewedCases` and `NumSuccessfulConvictions` determines your accuracy score. If your score falls below a certain threshold, you lose the ability to review cases.
* Sometimes, you might get the **no trees bug** when reviewing cases. This happens when you rewind to the start immediately after replay loads. To avoid this, when the replay first opens, play a few seconds into the first marker. Then move the scrobbler back to the start of the replay.
* When you click on `Submit verdict`, don't Alt-Tab or click anywhere. Sometimes, it bugs out and the verdict doesn't actually get submitted, even if you actually gave a verdict. You can crosscheck this with the second link provided.
* You can use [this tool](https://www.opendota.com/combos) on OpenDota to find the exact match, if you feel you like you need more info.
* Its a good idea to check the buyback status of the reported player at the start of the replay. Buying back super early in the game may itself not be enough for a guilty verdict. But if there are other small-to-medium level griefy behaviours, it can all add up to a guilty verdict (depends on rank too).

t3_m6i49b,What role should I pick to gain MMR points? +Party +Twitch,"So, I've been struggling with getting additional MMR points. I'm currently rated between 200 and 300 MMR points. And I'd need some advice on what position is best suited for that?

**Midlane Viper** 

I devised this strategy for getting MMR points, which was this unorthodox Viper build that I play on the midlane, especially the Dire midlane. Basically I buy the arcane boots and stack camps and try to farm really efficiently, instead of harassing the opponent with poison attack, so basically all the mana goes into nether toxin, and zero mana go into harassing into the opponent. That also means they're having a good game, but I'm having a better game coz Nether toxin is great for farming camps. On the direside, you can also do this 3-stack routine, of stacking the rightmost camp by casting nethertoxin on it at ##:48  and then stack the two lower left hand side camps by attacking them at ##:52 and ##:55 and then kind of running towards the tower. 

The next item I buy is always Heart of Tarrasque. Viper is legit the only hero in the game that can pull this strategy off for various reasons, which is also why I'm doing this in part. As it's an unorthodox spell damage builds tanky, a lot of the standard counters on the DOTA2 wiki page somewhat fail, but not all of them. And also some additional heroes are really strong vs this build, probably the most devastating opponent is Morphling, which is not even a counter for the standard Viper build.

**DOTA2 itemization has a lot of farming lean or bias on it**

One of the differences of DOTA compared to other games is that the competitive pvp encounter involves farming. Which has the effect that people build their heroes putting a lot of weight into farming rate. So you have heroes building battlefury, which is slightly suboptimal for simple pvp, but increases farming rates a lot. So that's where this Viper build comes in. Viper is just about the only hero that is efficient at farming without building any real items for it. You can basically do it with just arcane boots and farm a lot of gold, especially when the lvl10 spell lifesteal talent comes around. Which means you can also itemize the hero for pvp directly and just ignore farming. That means you can afford to build more defensively, towards the more optimal 1v1 type of build. And Heart of Tarrasque does that immediately. 

**Long-term sustained fight strategy**

The purpose of this build is not to win by bursting the opponent down very quickly, instead it's to win over time and win a sutsained fight, if you can prolong the duration of the fight, and you're building heart as first item, that means you get to regenerate a lot more health. Additionally Viper has a passive ability that gives them magical resistance and some other minor effects, and being an agility hero, they get a reasonable armor even before you build armor pieces, so the Heart of Tarrasque is a decent item to get as 2nd item (1st is arcane boots). 

Poison attack takes some time to stack but if an opponent remains within vicinity, it'll do a lot of damage over time. Usually the problem is that people find it easy to run away. But that's fine, because this is built in this defensive and tanky way. Nethertoxin then is an important defensive tool, which also does the more damage the longer the fight, or rather, the longer the opponent remains in it's effect, and it strips several tough opponents of their passive abilities. Basically you want to time the nethertoxin very well, and also make sure that you're on it yourself, so if an opponent engages you, they'll have to take damage from the toxin. I.e. don't cast it on them, but keep the optional to defend yourself with it instead.

Along with this sustained fight strategy I often build items like Assault Cuirass, Lotus Orb, Sange &amp; Yasha, or Heaven's Halberd, recently I've started liking Butterfly, Eye of Skadi, Shiva's Guard. Basically after the first 2 items you've to be very careful and analyze the opposing team's line up to figure out what item is going to be most crucial in this game. You've to take into account their damage types, their passive abilities, burst potential, and think about what's your game plan to survive these opponents. Luckily this unorthodox build doesn't have a lot of strong counters. The hardest counter is morphling, and after that I think probably Chaos Knight, because CK has an insane dmg output, and your plan is to tank and prolong the fight, well it's gonna happen with CK coz you can't tank the damage. Still if you've very much outfarmed them and have something like Shiva's Guard and say Heaven's Halberd, it's not easy to take you down quickly even on CK, but that still is a hard counter for this build. Other additional hard opponents include Clinkz, simply because this is a spell damage build, clinkz does a lot of damage, and they always build orchid. Depending on opposing team's lineup, though, clinkz does physical damage, and if the opposing team is very heavy on physical damage, it's easier to stack armor. Blademail and Halberd are nice items vs Clinkz with build. Another very difficult opponent is Terrorblade. It's very similar to CK in a lot of senses, but they also always build of Eye of Skadi. Which is really strong against Heart of Tarrasque, basically the Skadi applies a magic immunity piercing damage over time effect on you that does 40dmg per second, or something like that

 (well I think the base regen from Tarrasque is only like 50hp or something, so if you lose 40% of that it's only 20dps, but with additional levels and other health increasing items that value could increase)

Notably though the way this game is made, Sange actually counters the effect of Skadi to some extent, since the Skadi doesn't interfere with Sange's health gain, you instead have the same effect from Sange, but now your health regen is proportionally increased more from the Sange due to having retroactively lost a chunk of the base regen. So it's a bit counter-intuitive, but having sange helps vs skadi, but just a bit, since it's still a strong item. Of course, Sunder, is the real reason why Terrorblade counters this build, and Eye of Skadi is like icing on the cake.

**Some timings**

The timing for this is if all goes well, 2:00 for arcane boots and 12:00 for Heart of Tarrasque. That means you've a networth of 6200 gold at 12:00. Which is a really competitive value. But since you're spending less time denying creeps and harassing opponent, they're also going to have a good networth, but it's more likely to be something like 4500-5500 when you're at 6200. But this is only possible on the Dire side, because of the 3-stack routine, that's not possible on Radiant. Which impacts the Heart timing a lot, a good time on the Radiant side is 13:45 while 12:00 is good on the Dire side. Which is why this build is better played on the Dire side.

**But I got a bit bored of this**

So I managed to gain quite a few MMR points playing this Viper midlane, but I got bored with it. And I like playing Captain's mode, but I tend to lose points playing other roles, and so I've fallen back a lot again after basically playing all the other stuff. So now I need some new ideas on how can I get more MMR points?

**Trying to get points playing Hard Support**

So I try to stack camps, pull creeps, harass, place wards efficiently so they're harder to deward, and I also like to itemize my supports keeping an eye on the opposing team's lineup and figure out which opposing hero I can help to counter. E.g. I sometimes buy Orchid of Malevolence if the opposing team has midlane Storm Spirit. Not because I would do more damage myself, but preventing the SS from retreating when they're doing a gank attempt and there's someone else who can take them down. And so on stuff like that. But I find it very difficult to gain any points, which I find strange because it's rare to see the opponents even pulling creeps at the Herald level, and usually no one else does a lot of stacking. In fact often the carries don't even understand the significance of pulling properly. But regardless of this I mostly just end up losing points if I try to play support.

t3_m6mdam,This game would be infinitely better without the RNG elements imbedded at its core,"There are many RNG elements that just flat out nobody enjoys being in the game, just to list off a couple:

Power Rune spawns, damage spread, uphill misses against creeps, damage spread on non heroes, many abilities that make or break games on their rng

Like there are a few heroes in the game where RNG is core to their identity. But most of them have even seen buffs to remove a lot of the swing from them.

Chaos knight removed the random ult spawns, had a cooldown on E for a short time, etc. You want to say chaos knight has a flavorful reason for damage spread? Sure. Illusion heroes? Totally okay with it.

But ESPECIALLY in mid a *LOT* of matchups are early wave dependant, but if you got fucked on the uphill misses and damage spread, sorry kiddo youre screwed. Trying to deny creeps from shadow fiend to prevent souls? Nah you uphill missed the range creep twice in a row and low rolled on two melee creeps on the second wave. Throw that out the window. Its the difference between getting your bottle before 4 minutes and getting the bottle on the 4:30 wave.

Winning lane? Did your opponent coin flip 2 runes in a row with bottle? You lost lane now.

There is literally no reason for this random damage spread on *literally everything in the game*. Creeps? Towers? Uphill? You will miss many creeps for no reason at all. Im not ok with the tower lowrolling 3 damage and the range creep low rolling 3 damage and so my high roll misses the creep under tower.

Solutions?

Remove all damage spread except for illusion heroes. Towers? Creeps? Heroes? All set to the median damage you see on the profile card permanently. Literally every player benefits from consistent damage.

Remove uphill misses when targeting creeps. Many positions in mid *literally nobody* benefits from because of these RNG chances. If the lane is frozen on your uphill, the uphill misses on the range creep will force it to shove back out unless you deny, and the opponent cant properly CS on the uphill. Neither player wants this. Keep uphill misses on buildings and heroes. No more missing that range creep like 3 times in a lane because RNG said so.

Add a double rune spawn at 4 minutes and 8 minutes or put back the bounty spawn on the vacant spawn. My opponent being lucky shouldnt make my bottle useless. Many times ill shove in the lane to get bottle priority but they will just walk to the other rune spawn with the creeps behind them and if they win 1-2 coin flips sucks for you, lane over you lost. The early ward for mid is entirely because of the 50/50 rune spawn so you can see which one it is before running to it, and your opponent can 50/50 a sentry to deward for a profit or put theirs down before you and thats *MORE* RNG swing because of the rune spawns.

#Point being there is far too much RNG in the core of mid lane in every capacity

The strongest mids right now all have damage bonuses or high enough damage/mobility to completely and totally remove RNG from the midlane. Spirit heroes will get every rune spawn. High flash farm removes the need to interact with your opponent in the lane. Puck, Death Prophet, Mars, all these heroes weaken the creeps a little bit, big nuke the entire wave and then fuck off and do something else.

The RNG factors punish you for interacting with your opponent and the lane for pretty much the entirity of it.",DotA2

t3_m5ubzp,7.8k MMR Mid Puck guide,"*Processing img 142zddk5y8n61...*

**Previous episode for position 4/5 Puck:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m2mt3o/the\_nimble\_drafting\_option\_puck\_position\_4\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/m2mt3o/the_nimble_drafting_option_puck_position_4_guide/) 

Puck is one of the most versatile heroes in the game as it can be rotated into position 2, 3, 4 and even 5. 

In fact, in professional games, we see Puck played in various positions in the recent Europe DPC:

* Puppey and Notail plays position 5 Puck
* Taiga plays position 4 Puck
* Chessie plays position 3 Puck
* w33 and Topson play position 2 Puck. 

Puck can be impactful no matter the position played. Without lane restrictions, Puck is an extremely versatile pick during the drafting phase and you can conceal your strategies by picking it early. 

The focus of this guide, however, is on position 2 Puck, arguably the most common role Puck is played in pubs. Puck can clear creep waves instantly and is able to escape from danger as long as you have great map awareness. This allows Puck to shove waves deeply without getting caught, something extremely valuable for the mid-late game phase.

# Laning Phase for Puck

For Puck, fighting against tanky and high regen heroes might be unfavourable because Puck is constantly dishing damage on enemy heroes with its decent right-click damage and skirmish opportunities. Once you manage to get the enemy hero below a set threshold, you can then Illusory Orb + Waning Rift nuke your enemy to death. In fact, Puck is a mid hero capable of solo-killing its lane opponents more often than not.

As Puck relies on constant harass to do that, tanky mid heroes who can outregen your harass will be able to survive your onslaught. Heroes that fit into this category will be Dragon Knight, Timbersaw and arguably Kunkka mid. In these cases, you will need to go for plan B, which is to roam side lanes and get kills, winning lanes for your team. Puck is a great hero for skirmishes for two reasons:

* Puck's spells have short to medium cooldowns. Dream Coil has far lower cooldown compared to other AoE controls such as Ravage, Reverse Polarity and Black Hole.
* Puck generally has great middle rune control, as it can shove waves quickly before the rune spawns and then Orb towards one of the power rune respawn points.

# Skill Build for Puck

Puck is so versatile that even the skill build can be different for each player. It also varies as it depends on who you are going up against. 

For example, do you choose to pick up Phase Shift early during the laning phase or do you focus on maxing both Illusory Orb and Waning Rift for waveclear? If you fight against a hero like Queen of Pain you obviously want Phase Shift ASAP, but in some cases Phase Shift may be obsolete, by all means max your first two damage spells first. 

My personal favourite skill build would be either: 

* Q/W/Q/W/Q/R/Q/W/W/E
* Q/E/Q/W/Q/R/Q/W/W/W

At level 10, it is not recommended to take the talent first as you either take the chance to max out your damage duo, or take a point in Phase Shift because at level 10 you should be actively fighting. 

At level 12, I also prefer not to take level 2 Dream Coil, opting instead for higher levels in Phase Shift for better survivability. Level 2 of Dream Coil does not bring noticeable benefits compared to having more and longer Phase Shifts for better survivability. 

If you choose to get Phase shift during laning, you can constantly try to harass the enemy and dodge their attacks once every 6 seconds. This allows you to gain an upper hand advantage in the lane and can execute kills with perfect calculation during the laning phase. If you choose to max Illusory Orb and Waning Rift, try to deal damage to the enemy using your nukes while taking last hits at the same time. 

[I very often see amateur Puck players using Phase Shift everytime when it is off cooldown to dodge whatever that is coming for them. DON'T DO THAT. In this screenshot, if the Puck commits a Phase Shift just to dodge Invoker's right click, the Invoker will likely chain stun Puck with Snap + Tornado + EMP and the Puck will potentially die.](https://preview.redd.it/oescqasz59n61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=098ae25f14ca59d64d910ff17c07200c98d4e55c)

This applies to both builds, when you reach level 10, you will surely have both Illusory Orb and Phase Shift maxed. At this time, you can farm more efficiently, speed up your items and split push dangerous lanes for your other cores. (Works best if you pick up an early Boots of Travel) Bring supports around you to keep ganking enemies with your coil as Puck wants to be constantly fighting. You are the primary space creator. You can be the position 2, or the position 2.5, depending on whatever your team needs you to be. Call for ganks or even smokes everytime your Dream Coil is off cooldown. In fact, the cooldown is so short, you can even commit it for solo pickoffs.

Sub-section regarding Phase Shift blinking:

[Against ground DPS or Void's Chronosphere, Puck can actually blink out of it coupled with Phase Shift, as long as you are blinking in the correct direction, because turn rates are a thing in Dota.](https://preview.redd.it/pzb6zdjg69n61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8fb47752746c124333eaa51e3381eb9eedc12dc)

[As long as you are facing the direction you want to blink, you can generally escape things like Void's Chronosphere or even Jakiro's Macropyre.](https://preview.redd.it/080lmlpl69n61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea3f6d60a002583af8a4fba01c3bafdf566afe2a)

[And it fails. Notice the Puck is trying to turn right to complete the turn required to Blink out. In these situations you should just blink towards the enemy base instead to escape Chronohpere, as Puck was facing that direction.](https://preview.redd.it/lpc7pjys69n61.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6ff0c03c9a809b26fc01fbb11a6ffcbbaf85456)

# Item Build for Puck

Core Puck can be categorised into two types, which being either physical damage Puck and magical damage Puck. Both playstyles has seen plays in the pro scene as both are often used depending on the situation. Of course, the item build will change drastically along with the playstyle.

# Physical Damage Item Build

**√ Witch Blade:** One of the most essential item for physical Puck. Deal 1x your intelligence as damage every second for three seconds to the enemy. For early game Puck, it can deal quite a lot of damage to enemy heroes. It also increases the projectile speed and attack speed for Puck which is very efficient as a physical attack Puck. (NOTE: If you use Phase Shift attack to proc Witch Blade, the first target your projectile lands on will proc the Witch Blade passive.)

**√ Blink Dagger:** Effective item for Puck as it allows Puck to combo with its Illusory Orb to slither in and out of fights. Phase Shift + Blink is also an effective get-out-of-jail card, sans a few extremely hard to dodge DPS spells such as Dark Seer's Ion Shell, Batrider's Firefly and even a good Weaver's Shukuchi under your face.

**√ Eul’s Scepter of Divinity:** An escape item for Puck to primarily dispel silence or avoid stuns when Phase Shift or Illusory Orb is in cooldown. Silence is a very hard counter against a Puck no matter which builds the Puck is playing as Puck is a skill-based hero so having an item to dispel silence is significantly important if the enemy has silences or Orchid to deal with you.

**√ Maelstrom:** Once you reached level 15 and have Phase Shift attack talent, you can potentially attack lots of units at once, which allows you to have high chances to proc the chain lightning. It is useful at clearing creeps and also helps in dishing out damage especially in prolonged teamfights.

**√ Desolator:** Another damage type item that could heavily punish supports if they are out of position. Physical damage Puck with desolator is scary against supports. He can dive into the supports’ face, and coupled with Waning Rift's silence, insta-kill squishy supports with just a few hits. Take note with Phase Shift attack or Rapid Fire, the Desolator Armor debuff is applied to everyone struck, as opposed to Maelstrom and Witch Blade.

**√ Daedalus:** As usual, used for dealing massive damage if it procs. A good item to buy with Puck’s Dream Coil Rapid Fire talent. Daedalus can proc against multiple targets with Rapid Fire / Phase Shift attack.

**√ Nullifier:** Useful against Ghost, Glimmer and Euls.

**√ Divine Rapier:** Can be bought if you have great confidence in your survivability. Can provide a huge damage boost to Dream Coil Rapid Fire and Phase Shift attack. Generally the last resort in stalemates or comeback attempts.

**√ Refresher Orb:** This allows you to have double Dream Coil, which can be used to burst down enemy cores with your high damage output in the late game. Double Dream Coils with Rapid Fire on multiple heroes can be a death sentence for the enemy team, especially in the late game.

# Magical Damage Item Build

**√ Blink Dagger:** Explained above.

**√ Eul’s Scepter of Divinity:** Explained above.

**√ Boots of Travel:** This allows you to move quickly to lanes to split push and still be able to join fights immediately. Great for a Puck who wants to shove waves to inflict lane pressure on the enemy as deep as possible towards their base.

**√ Dagon:** High damage burst with a low cooldown. Very effective to use for Puck as itgg could burst heroes with low hp and retreat from the danger zone without any casualties. Recommended going for this item when your team lacks burst damage.

**√ Linken’s Sphere:** When you need to protect yourself from single target instant stuns like Lion’s and Shadow Shaman’s Hex, this could be a great item to defend yourself. Puck is vulnerable to long-duration disables as it is disgustingly squishy, almost like gelatin. Remember, Puck is hard to catch, but once caught, you die instantly.

**√ Bloodstone:** Great item that boosts mana regen and damage output of Puck. Another recommended item when you have confidence in yourself where you would not easily be caught. Having mana regen allows you to keep split pushing and pressuring lanes. In fact, you'll probably be healthy forever.

**√ Ethereal Blade:** This item is good to be bought when you think you have the potential to burst down the enemy by using magic damage. Do not purchase this item when you are going for semi support type of Puck as you will be relying on your carry's physical damage. Only go for this if you are a magical Puck that is snowballing.

**√ Scythe of Vyse:** Great to purchase when your team lacks single target control against key targets, or you think you need it to solo kill enemy heroes. However, Aghanim's Scepter is generally better in most situations. 

**√ Shiva’s Guard:** If you think the enemy could not burst you down even with disables, especially if they rely mainly on physical damage, Shivas is a decent item. Great especially against Tinker hiding in the treelines.

**√ Aeon Disk:** If you find yourself struggling to survive, by all means go for Aeon Disk. The instant dispel can allow you to chain Illusory Orb and Phase Shift instantly for a guaranteed escape. A very good item for Puck in the late game especially if the enemy heroes have a lot of instant disables capable of instakilling you. 

**√ Octarine Core:** Reduces cooldown which allows you to do more damage and silence more opponents in a team fight. Would be useful if you have an extra slot, but I do not prioritise this item in an intense game as it does not help much for late intense game Puck gameplay. (I will generally go for this as the last item if slots are available.)

# Overall Item Build

**√ Aghanim Scepter:** Obscenely broken. **Who decided that this can pierce BKB?** Carries and slippery enemies like Storm Spirit, Ember Spirit and Void Spirit hate this item. Actually, I am pretty sure everyone on the opposing team will hate you for this item. It's just ridiculously stupid to have an AoE long range BKB-piercing disable, especially when the duration on both the coil and the snap stun is equally ridiculous.

**√ Aghanim Shard:** Recommend against invis heroes for obvious reasons. It is also good to combo the item with Psychic Headband that could instantly push out enemies to break the coil. 

# Talent Tree for Puck

Similar to the previous Shadow Fiend’s guide, there will be two choices of choosing the talent tree for Puck as there are two different builds. 

**In the first choice of talent at level 10**, the magical build would rather go for 150 cast range while the physical build would go for 30 damage. 

**At level 15**, it's fairly straightforward as well. Physical damage would surely prefer Phase Shift attack for obvious reasons. 12% spell amplification would be a huge damage boost to magical Puck especially for those with Ethereal Blade and Dagon build.

**Moving on to level 20**, which might differ from each player to another. Some players prefer to go for 50% illusory orb distance/speed while some might choose -6s warning rift cooldown. 50% speed and distance allow you to escape further or join fights from a longer range, which is useful against heroes like Void Spirit and Ember Spirit. You can either catch up with them, or escape from them. -6s Waning Rift talent however is not only great for wave clear, it also synergizes with the level 25 talent.

**At level 25**, physical build players would go for Dream Coil Rapid Fire. This talent turns Puck into an AoE physical monster. On the other hand, +275 warning right AoE and range is very useful for the magic build as it could be used for either escape or attack. The silence AoE is so ridiculous you stand to easily silence multiple targets in teamfights (and often multiple times, too)

**Conclusion**

Puck is broken in the current meta not just because of its kit being useful in almost every game, Puck is also broken due to the versatility it brings to drafting. It all comes down to different matchups and different playstyles by different players. Both builds bring great benefits to the table, whether it may be huge AoE physical damage, deep waveclears or just consistent disables.

Thank you for reading until the end.

t3_m67oqc,Huskar Suggestion: EITHER increase Level 4 Inner Fire damage to one-shot range creeps OR apply one stack of current level of Burning Spear to units hit by Inner Fire,"Huskar is one of the most situational heroes in DotA and is extremely difficult to play against a lot of heroes. He is definitely strong and cheesy in certain lineups, but even in those lineups, he can be countered with items. He has awful base damage, awful movement speed, terrible attack range, awful armor (and agility gain), weird attack animation where the projectile does damage a moment after it hits the target, and he farms really slow.

I like Inner Fire as a spell and concept, but every time you walk into a creepwave after you have Lvl4 Inner Fire, you can't help my wish you didn't have to hit the ranged creep once after hitting it with a Lvl4 Inner Fire. Inner Fire radius is 500, but Huskar's attack range is 400, which means he sometimes will have to move to secure that as well. It's just annoying.

Give it 10/20/30/40 extra damage at four levels, or allow it to apply current level of Burning Spear on all targets hit (even if for half-duration).

*Arcane Aura gains a new passive component that empowers CM's basic attacks and spells with freezy magic.*

CM's basic attacks steal 1/3/5/7 attack speed and 1/1/2/2 movement speed from an enemy hero on hit.  CM's spells steal 1/2/2/3 attack speed and 1 movement speed from an enemy hero on damage proc.

t3_m5gra9,Why does Void Spirit have 200 attack range?,"I know he has a long staff or whatever. But for some reason he has crazy good attack range, and heroes like Sven and Legion Commander who have longer weapons - and awkward attack animations because of it - have to make do with 150.

Sven is out here hitting with the hilt of his sword because no money in the budget for good attack range. PL has a lance, Slardar has a whole damn TRIDENT, Centaur has that big old axe, Legion and Magnus both use halberds...And I guess I could live with that if it wasn't for the fact that Mars has 250 and Underlord has 175. So clearly there is some ability to give heroes extra attack range if it makes sense. I guess Sven's attack animation ""makes sense.""

I am genuinely infuriated by Void Spirit's ability to last hit ranged creeps from the low ground with 85 damage + a 70 damage Resonant Pulse that also gives him a physical damage shield. It's not that he's broken, necessarily, just that it's preferential treatment and kind of unpleasant to play against. Many other heroes, like Ember Spirit and Alchemist, are forced to get 50 range closer in order to hit creeps. Imagine OD with 50 more attack range, or Morphling with 50 less. Imagine if Kunkka could attack from the low ground at 200 range to W that ranged creep, securing it before you have the chance to deny it and dealing 120 damage to you in the process.

And to say nothing of the fact that Templar Assassin has 240 attack range with one point in E. She barely outranges Void Spirit, and is outranged by Mars.

I know I'm probably opening up some dangerous territory for certain heroes to get buffed in ways that make them more difficult to play against, instead of my INTENDED crusade which is to nerf Void Spirit. I apologize for my fellow caster-playing support homies out there, who may end up with slightly less capacity to harass heroes like phantom lancer, sven, centaur, and slardar thanks to me waking Icefrog up to their dumbass animations and nonsensical radii of influence. But I simply cannot stand by and allow Void Spirit to have 200 range unchallenged. Not in good conscience.",DotA2
t3_m5ercs,Idea for a Storm Surge rework to make Razor more engaging to play,"**Storm Surge:**
  
- *Removed passive 12/16/20/24% movement speed bonus.*
- Now passively removes the movement speed cap for Razor. 

&amp;nbsp;

- For every 0.1 second that Razor is moving he passively gains bonus movement speed up to a total of 18/22/26/30% bonus movement speed. 
- Lasts until Razor stops moving. 
- Requires Razor to be moving for a constinuous 7/6/5/4 seconds to reach peak effect. 

&amp;nbsp;

- For every 0.1 second that Razor is NOT moving he passively gains bonus attack speed up to a total of 25/30/35/40 bonus attack speed. 
- Lasts until Razor starts moving. 
- Requires Razor to be stationary for a continuous 3.5/3/2.5/2 seconds to reach peak effect. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Aghanim's Shard Upgrade:**
  
- Adds an active component to Storm Surge:
- When activated, ""locks"" the current Storm Surge buff for 10 seconds, during this time Razor will not lose the accrued bonus movement speed when he stands still, and will not lose the accrued bonus attack speed when he starts moving. 
- Mana Cost: 50
- Cooldown: 30 seconds
- Also passively makes Razor immune to slow effects when he has the maximum movement speed bonus from Storm Surge, and grants Razor +15 agility when he has the maximum attack speed bonus from Storm Surge.",DotA2

t3_m63rj1,Saw that Necro was the only unpicked hero in all 6 DPC regions and thought I might share some suggestions to spice him up a bit,"1. Buyback-blocking on Reaper’s Scythe, but only as an upgrade, whether through a talent (probably level 25), or through aghs/shard. Reaper’s Scythe’s respawn timer increase is an incredibly powerful effect that can arguably be more devastating than almost any other single-target ult in the lategame. Compare to Doom; heavy DPS, and *complete* ability/item disabling for a substantial amount of time, but very low “risk” besides an enemy buying linkens.


I suggest returning the buyback block to Reaper’s Scythe to emphasize the nature of the ability; relatively difficult to land reliably, but seriously devastating when it works. In an endgame teamfight you might Scythe the enemy core, but the respawn timer is wasted by them immediately buying back. The risk of *full* death would demand heavier counterplay with items like linkens, or significant focus on saving the core with items like Pipe or Glimmer Cape



2. The current Agh’s effect is (in my opinion) one of the most boring and uninspiring in the game. It’s not *bad* per-say, it’s just underwhelming and highly situational. I propose an Agh’s that adds a new ability that is more thematically aligned with the hero as well as having very interesting tactical potential



**Outbreak**: Afflict target enemy unit with a plague that grows in intensity over time, slowing and damaging for more each second it lasts. If the infected unit dies, it bursts, infecting all nearby enemy units and increasing the duration on any that are already infected.

(Does not pierce immunity, and can be dispelled by any dispel)



There is currently no “spreading debuff” of this sort in the game, even with a hero who’s entire theme is about disease and plagues and decay. I think that such an ability would be perfect for Necro, as it would not only fit his lore, but fits well with his skillset and playstyle. It amplifies his strengths around fighting large numbers of enemies (ie fighting around creep waves or in the jungle) and creates a unique positioning dilemma for enemies. I know this is *somewhat* similar to Magnetize, but I think that the “increasing intensity” as well as the fact that it spreads and grows on its own (rather than via blowing up remnants) makes it a unique concept. 


It doesn’t even necessarily need to be a simple DoT slow. It could apply an increased strength Heartstopper Aura debuff to affected enemies, or steal enemy regen/speed for Necro, or maybe affected units send out a weaker Death Pulse that spreads the infection every couple seconds.



3. The hero desperately needs a movement speed increase, even a small one. Necro relies very heavily on being able to position himself in fights to maximize his Q, but often struggles to do so due to the constant mobility buffs that many carries are seeing. Necro has a pitiful 280 base movespeed on a hero where positioning can be so key, in a meta where mobility is so available to other cores. 


This could also possibly be addressed by suggestion 2, if the plague did something like stealing some movement speed from each afflicted enemy (similar to Battle Hunger)




I’m curious to hear what thoughts other people have about these suggestions. I miss Necro being something other than a worse Lesh or DP.",DotA2

Hello dears. (English)

Hello, I love the Dota 2 game and I have spent money on every compendium that has come out in recent years, but honestly I find their ranked matchmaking system that they implemented lately (I can't remember the exact date) and I have given myself It counts, not only me, but almost all Dota 2 players, that you use the algorithm so that all Dota 2 players are forced to have a 50% win rate, which is totally UNFAIR AND INTOLERABLE.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am very sorry, that until now (March 2021) you have not realized that more and more people HATE THE DOTA 2 GAME because, you simply do not want to improve your ranked matchmaking system, making people who want to stand out and raise their MMR, YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, since simply their lousy ranked matchmaking system uses a lousy ranked matchmaking algorithm that forces us UNFAIR and unpleasant to conform and force ourselves to have a 50% win rate and become failures for the entire duration. life, without allowing us to GROW, PLEASE have the KINDNESS to go back to the PREVIOUS ranked matchmaking system, where they allowed us as DOTA 2 players to grow and not continue to be failed and stagnant players, as I repeat again, their lousy ranked matchmaking system in the game DOTA 2, the only thing it has achieved is that now fewer and fewer people want to play Dota 2, due to its lousy system unfair qualifying match of the 50% winrate algorithm that you implemented for us and that you do not even want to end that injustice in the game dota 2. That has us rooted in TOTAL failure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Postscript 1: I love the Dota 2 game and have been a Dota player for 12 years, when Dota 2 didn't even exist, and today (03/14/2021) I express my utter discomfort with their current ranked matchmaking system and I'm doing it because I want to May this game be enjoyable for EVERYONE, I swear to you with what you have been doing, that fewer and fewer people want to play Dota 2 because of that lousy RANKED MATCHING SYSTEM, PLEASE do something.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They do not allow Dota 2 to end up being forgotten, and that nobody wants to play DOTA 2, what I say is not only to criticize them but simply, I want this game to allow users to grow as players and as people, PLEASE do something.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can even tell you with complete security and firmness; Take a survey on, satisfaction in the current ranked matchmaking, I'm pretty sure nobody, read me right, NOBODY IS HAPPY, since they implemented their lousy system ranked matchmaking system with the MANDATORY winrate of 50%.

t3_m62uli,My current experience with Dota2,"After almost 5k hours, i played 8 dota games this year. This post is about the last one, 5889850154. Crusader bracket, i was Pangolier.

Since i wasn't playing a lot of dota this year, i figured i would play a normal game. After 12minutes of not finding a match i gave up (SA server). Then, i went for a ranked role games with all options marked, found match in 15seconds as offlane.

We won bot lane really hard, enemy Jugg bought back and went jungle after his third or fourth death we successfully tilted him. ""Game won"", i thought. But since it's Dota2 we're talking about, i was obviously wrong.

Our mid, Necrophos, wanted to destroy bot tower before destroying top t2. We did roshan without him and Luna got the aegis. 3 people (including luna with aegis) were pushing top but Necro and Venge were pushing bot, really weird.

Obviously, they died as we took top racks, but then we died fighting with number disadvantage. Next fight we went mid without aegis, Venge followed but Necro continued to insist to go bot, said he was a very good player and we should follow him, we took mid and died. Later, he tried to go bot alone again, died and instantly bought back. I used my only report on him for griefing that exact same moment.

Few minutes later, they were arguing that they should report luna for not having a bkb, but if Necro was top we would have won the game without luna's bkb. Some xenophobic comments aside (i muted Necro), disruptor starts calling someone ""macaquito"". I was out of reports, but managed to report him for racism at the end of the match as communication abuse. 

I obviously lost 30 MMR after crushing my lane. And i wouldn't need to worry about that if could find a normal game, which i didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: Overwatch came too late. The Dota community needs fixing ASAP, but we still don't know how much Overwatch will actually improve the community. It may just give a psychological effect of a ""report that works"", since Valve didn't say anything about punishment yet. Meanwhile, the fact that i didn't find a normal match in 12 minutes is really worrying. NA and EU redditors insist that the game is not dying because they can find matches normally, ignoring all the posts about the matchmaking of more ""remote"" servers like Australia or South Africa.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: i don't play dota lately and when i do, i get reminded of why i don't: griefing, racism and losing 30 MMR on a game that i CRUSHED my lane.",DotA2

t3_m5v7y4,New Player Experience Minigame: The Laning Phase,"the idea is to the laning phase into mini game that will give new players a foundational understanding of the game that they can apply to understand the game at large.

the game is 1 lane, 2v2, 2 towers, 2 pull camps, and maybe a bounty rune. Hero pool is limited to conceptually straightforward and balanced heroes, with the item pool limited and balanced as well. Games last about 10 minutes, you win by taking the enemy tower or having higher networth at the end of 10 minutes.

New players could efficiently learn important fundamentals such as pulling, starting items and skill builds that apply to later stages of the game. This way we wouldn't have players with 6000 hours who don't understand when to buy wind lace, magic stick, etc. in their starting items. The games would be more convenient for new players, a group of 4 new players could play their own game without worrying about 6 other wildcards. Smurfs would be dissuaded as they want to play real dota.

I'm no creator so im just throwing the idea out there. I think something like this mode should be an official playlist, maybe limited to people with sub 100 hours. Dota needs an ""easy"" mode and this is the closest thing i can think to it.",DotA2

t3_m61eaq,Attempting to make BH works on the highest competitive levels (TI Main scenes),"*...after changing the numbers quite a lot to rebalance.*

*look, position 4 BH doesn't work on competitive levels, not really.*

he skipped the last 2 TIs (2018 and 2019) and the buffs he got on the newest 7.28 patch means that he's not that good on 2020 either. *Plus he's not too viable on competitive scenes on 2017 EITHER!* *thats 4 years! years!!* He needs some reworks to be viable on those levels.

This is because he's been nerfed on a fundamental basis.

back then, its completely possible that there are pos 5s with mere 1k networth on 15 minutes into the game when he's fighting BH. since all of their money went for 100 gold (now 75), 850 radius (now 1000) sentries, that lasted for 240 seconds (now 480). Plus there were no neutral items that can give HP and armor to the squishiest supports. BH's lunch if he's doing well.

**Buffs:**

**I.** Changes Shadow Walk to **Shadow Assassination**

Bounty Hunter becomes invisible and gains the ability to move through other units until he attacks or uses an ability. When he breaks the invisibility, he releases a smoke that slow his enemies’ movement speed while strengthening BH. Bounty Hunter’s Jinada cooldown is reduced if he attacks inside the smoke.

**Cast Animation:** 0+0

**Fade Time:** 1/0.75/0.5/0.25

**Invisibility Duration:** 17/24/31/38 s

**Move Speed Slow:** 11/19/27/35%

**Jinada cooldown reduction:** 15/30/45/60%

**Smoke Duration:** 3.5/4/4.5/5 s

**Smoke Radius:** 225/300/375/450

*cooldown:* 38/31/24/17

*mana cost:* 100/130/160/190

*Notes:*

1. Pretty big mana cost, can't stay invisible now. Our boy is no longer a scout, he now goes invis for the kill! Or to escape, the slowing smoke would help a bit on that front.
2. Slow is gone 0.5 second after enemies escaped the smoke. Typical aura treatment.
3. while it is forming, smoke position = BH's position for 0.2 seconds, even if he blinks.

**II.** Grants BH sub-skill: **Shadow Break**

Bounty Hunter cancels his invisibility.

**Cast Animation:** 0+0

*cooldown:* 1

*mana cost:* 0

*Notes:*

1. Used to trigger the smoke when you can’t attack or use items. Or just escape dust’s slow.

**Nerfs:**

**I.** **Track**

1. ***Track no longer gives BH gold if he’s outside of track range.*** *(he receive normal self track gold otherwise)*
2. ***Track Aura Reduced from 1200 to 1000.***
3. ***Track Aura Ally Bonus gold reduced from 40/80/120 to 30/40/50***
4. **Reduces track cast range from 1000 to 700/775/850.**
5. **Reduces track duration from 30 seconds to 18/21/24 seconds.**
6. Track no longer gives BH 16%/20%/24% bonus movement speed when he's near tracked units. He instead receive 10/14/18% Status resistance. *The hunter feels invigorated when he's near his prey, he won't sleep until his prey is down.*
7. Aghanim Shard no longer makes track to give 600 AoE vision and movement speed around the target (moved to jinada rework)

*Notes:* Track is too OP, anyway. the big thing are that now, BH needs to be alive to get his paycheck, which would leads to less gold income if you're playing him too aggressively. well, with the track cast range reduction and team gold reduction, it overall means less gold for BH anyway. The status resistance change is more of a tweak, it's intended so BH have slightly more survivability without moving and running away; so that pos 3 BH will actually tank a bit.

**II.** **Shuriken Toss**

1. Shuriken Toss no longer mini stuns. It instead slow ms by 70% for 0.7 second.

*Notes:*

1. the slow kinda helps BH a bit to make enemies stay within the smoke, but it's still a nerf... since now, enemies can just tp away. You still want heavy stunner allies for BH to deliver jinada beat downs.
2. Worse on teamfights too, since you probably need the ministun as an option to cancel a cm ult or something similar...

**Reworks:**

**I. Jinada**

1. Increase Jinada cooldown to 13/10/7/4
2. Increase Jinada gold steal to 14/26/38/50
3. Removes aghanim shard's buff on track. now causes Jinada attacks to silence enemies for 1.4 second. (this applies to jinada on shuriken too)

*Notes:*

this basically makes Jinada a bit worse on lane, but arguably better on teamfights --if your aghs Scepter and shard are both online.

**II. Talents**

**level 20** *Jinada +50 gold steal* changed to *15% Cooldown Reduction*

**Level 25** *+40% Evasion* changed to *+35% Shadow Assassination Slow*

**Overall Meaning:**

with my changes, i'm intending to change him into an offlaner more than a carry. I'm doing that by giving him a pretty huge mana problem which he doesn't exactly have before, and also NOT granting him any abilities to help him farming, which is carry go to method to catch up from losing lanes. Well, he can definitely be a carry, but it'll be pretty niche, picked only when a good player knows he can win the lane.

&amp;#x200B;

IMHO, Capability wise;

He went from (Before-after)

|Lane presence:|6.5/10|6/10|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Teamfight:|2/10|7/10|
|Carry:|3.5/10|7/10|
|Tankiness:|4/10|5.5/10|
|Ganking:|8/10|4/10|
|Farming|1/10|2/10|
|Support:|4/10|2.5/10|
|Peak time:|5-15 minutes|15-30 minutes|

I played Kunkka for the first time in months a few hours ago and it was the most fun I’ve had in DOTA in a long time.  Had a game where our mid picked dark willow against WK, Ursa, Axe.  We had no business winning with such little carry.  So as offline I said fuck my usual go to aura items and went OG Kunkka for the hell of it. And dammit we won, and it was FUN

Damn win rates, play what you think is fun.  That’s what games are supposed to be

Edit: I saw someone refer to Kunkka aghs as “turning the game into a waterpark” and now I love him even more",DotA2
t3_m5sm1f,Make an option to disable automatic spell queueing,"I hate the fact that there's no way to disable spell queueing and I think it should be an option, given how DotA 2 is very customizable nowadays. Even at level 6, try pressing Tinker's R (Rearm) twice as fast as you can, it will start casting a second one. I really do not want this to happen because I have minor lag spikes and therefore when it lags, I press it again and it ofcourse starts casting again, wasting my mana, and I have to stop it manually using s (or moving if you didn't enable channeling requires s).

Hes being first picked or banned in most pro games and in every pub game i play in immortal.

to the people saying ""kill him early"" or ""stomp his lane"" (amongst other things which mostly boil down to the alch player being bad, or ur team just being better than the enemies), you are literally repeating the ""just ward spectre's jungle"" meme from a while back. Acid spray makes him pretty insane in lane and able to secure lasthits, hes naturally tanky as a str hero with decent armor, and he can jungle very easily with like 2 points in spray before he even gets his ult. Urn does nothing as he has 2 purges, simply outfarming him or pushing the advantage does nothing as hes never really weak /has his team to back him up and you cannot outfarm him, so what to do?

of course he doesn't win every game as sometimes the other team is just better than alchs, but in a perfect 50/50 scenario I don't see how he loses. Skadi is nice but 99 % of cores cant afford first item skadi and lose by the time they get it as a 2nd/3rd item they lose. Ignore the 4 other enemies you have to also fight when you are itemizing so much for just one. Also i see a lot of people saying shivas, what's that supposed to do lmao?

lastly, for whatever reason the gold formula seems pretty fucked up right now. I can kill an alch who has 0/1 deaths and has been hyperfarming for the last 10 minutes and get 600 gold, then my pos 4 dies and also gives 600 gold? theres something wrong with the gold formula right now.

t3_m51rqg,"Russian boosters reveal new bug, that allows you to calibrate 8000+ mmr from the new 100 hours account.","Anybody now can calibrate 8k+ mmr even if they have 1k mmr on main account.
Account sellers found a bug, that allows you to break limit of maximum potential mmr on account.
You can do this by just pressing SEASONAL recalibration button during the 100 hours of playing to unlock ranked games. You can use it at the end, after 10 games or when you are sure your hidden rating is really high.

Ok, we avoided the limited mmr and now lets talk about how to get 8000 mmr on your new account. Seems like dota devs created anti-smurf system, that works like this: if you have main account with 6k mmr and you decided to create new account, your hidden rating on it will be around 4-5k mmr and after playing unranked 100 hours u can increase it by having good winrate and stats.
Do u know what russian boosters did? They just find a guy with 9900 mmr account and all you have to do is to give him your new account he plays a few games on it or you can play on his account 1 unranked game, and thats it, your hidden mmr is already around 7-8k. A few accounts already listed on popular russian trade markets. 

Here are the proofs of these already calibrated accounts:

t3_m5i1m0,Why was strict region lock for MM removed?,"Serious question. It's getting out of hand in EU, only normal times to play there are late evenings when most russians are sleeping.

And please don't tell me I'm racist or whatever. You all know the problem of russians. I don't remember the last time I have met a normal russian. I'm not commenting on their gameplay, it's their attitude. When you get 2 russians in your team, 3 English speakers, you tell those russian guys that talk russian together ""English please"" and they reply ""fuck you american gamburger"". Easy solution is to mute them. But they proceed to play in a way where they would grief non-russian players. Stealing farm from a higher priority, intentionally not participating in defensive fights, ignoring roshan and so on.

So why on earth are Europeans matched with russians? Couple of years ago there was a region lock. Games were far more enjoyable. Why was it removed?

Russians don't want to play with Europeans (yet they still queue for EU servers with an excuse of ""lower ping"" and their lag is usually horrendous anyway), they don't want to communicate in English (there is a language option that is completely ignored), they have obvious hatred towards non-russians. There are other reasons too, from what I have seen in reddit and steam discussions, account buying and boosting is insanely common in russia since they get paid more for that than in their regular jobs. I haven't personally met any cheaters for a long time, but most of the posts complaining about cheaters are about cheating russians. Regional channels are flooded with russians selling cheats and boosting services. So if it is so common between them, why not lock them up together and leave innocent people alone? They obviously support those unfair services, let them use those between each other.

Also I remember seeing a similar post like mine when people explained that regional lock was removed to reduce queue times. At 4-5k I manage to find a game in less than 2 minutes. No matter the time. So if it will increase up to 10 or 20 minutes - still worth it?",DotA2

You hear a voice, it's one of your teammates, but he is salty and starts blaming you for everything. It doesn't even make sense the things he says, but your team agrees with him when you ask them about it. You look up at the scoreboard and see that they are all in the same guild, you look at the enemies and they are also all in the same guild. You are now playing a game with 4 salty shitters VS a 5 man squad on the other team.

t3_m4oh6p,I don't regret playing Dota,"There have been a lot of posts on here about toxicity in the Dota community making it seem like it is some kind of unique hellscape that is not present in other online games. In my experience there are vastly more good games and average games than bad. I play in 3.5-4k mmr range at 10k behavior score. I see people encouraging each other when something is not going well and try to address issues as they come up. Nobody gives up until the game is truly over. Now after the game there is often a discussion or an argument in the post-game lobby but it  has no effect on gameplay.

In general I would say that playing Dota has been a net benefit in my life. I wouldn't put this on any resume but I definitely have ranked matchmaking to thank for a lot of applicable skills. I learned working in a team under pressure, handling personal mistakes, dealing with problem teammates, and overall mental strength. I feel like I am above average in workplace conflict resolution and at giving/receiving instructions.

I also want to add the following perspective as an average player and a frequent reader of this subreddit. These are just my opinions in an ordered list. 

1. Smurfs are NOT that common - people can sometimes have good games. Snowball effect of certain heroes exaggerates their success and impact on the game. 
2. Toxic teammates do happen but they are quite rare and they can be worked with. People getting emotional about the game can often be correct and make decent calls. As a good teammate you can help them not tilt. Worst-case scenario, there is always a mute button.
3. There is no chance that new players can handle even low mmr gameplay and I have no idea what to do about it.",DotA2

1. I can buy it along with the game with items that I desperately need (either directly or via arcane boots)
2. It gives me extra mana
3. It gives me extra mana regen
4. It gives me casting range that is very much needed 
5. It can be used to ged an OC in late game

Vs:

1. Blink
2. Have to save for that
3. Can´t have anything useful from the item in the future (I mean, arcane blink is something, but , meh)

And I get a lot of flaming from my carry players due to this. So what´s what I´m missing with this?

I usually play her offensively maxing W, then Q and E. Mostly because I think her E is too weak at the first 2 levels and it doesnt do as much for my carry as lowering half HP of the enemy heroes to keep them away from him and focusing on me. 

Since I spend all my gold on wards and potions my core item is a cheap CO which that synergizes very well with my 1 and 2 in teamfights and ganks , and from here I slowly go towards the AE in the best case scenarios and changing to other utility items if the need arises.

Mandatory long time reader first time poster

After many years of buying the battlepass (level500-800 for as long as I can remember), i decided to finally go that extra mile and go for the level1000 aegis reward in 2020. Of course with the pandemic and everything going on in the world, I haven't thought much about it after the BP ended. Fast forward to now and it suddenly crossed my mind that I hadn't gotten any emails or contact about getting my delivery info. Started to get a bad feeling when I started searching for news about the delivery for these rewards.

Raised a steam support ticket and turns out registration period has ended and their simple reply was that it's no longer possible. Feels really bad that when I purposely spent (way beyond normal) just for the level 1000 reward to be shut down by support. Turns out i somehow completely missed the button to click on the actual bp to register... Surely I'm not the only one in this boat?

Dying to get the reward somehow.. please help!

This is because Burning Army is still flagged as an ultimate ability (`""AbilityType""					""DOTA_ABILITY_TYPE_ULTIMATE""`): https://imgur.com/a/XKLSkrK

Since the game always shows the first native ability, that is flagged as ultimate, a hero carries for the green diamond indicator, it currently shows Burning Army (once learnt).

Removing this attribute from Burning Army fixes the green diamond for Clinkz and it will show Death Pact again.

*I even checked if this causes issues with Morphling’s Morph and it does not (he still does not get Burning Army), so it won’t affect any balancing and is only a cosmetic change.*

t3_m5b8wy,Aghanim Scepter Update - Anti-Mage (my 2 cents),"Currently, one of the most useless (if not the most) aghanim scepter upgrades available, is Anti-Mage's. Additionally, this means he never builds this item unless it is literally past 45 or 50 minutes. If it is to be viewed as ""situationally useful"", then it should have a much less cooldown and the illusion should either be stronger or last longer.

What it does currently:  Blinks an illusion at the target enemy or location and attack them for 7 seconds. Counterspell is replicated on the Blink Fragment illusion. -&gt; You can't control the created illusion and the illusion is the same as a Manta illusion (pretty weak). 20 second COOLDOWN

If needed, you can pick this up after a BF + Manta. AM would still have the requirement to farm up his BF because getting this first or second or skipping BF would hurt his farm and prowess greatly

So here it is:

Upgrades: BLINK

\*Reduces manacost of Blink to 30 (in half), improves cast point to 0.3 (currently 0.4) and grants ARCANE DISRUPTION to blink.

ARCANE DISRUPTION: Anti-Mage silences and slows enemy attack/movement speed by 40% in a 400 aoe at the arriving destination for 2 seconds. (66% slow/silence downtime based on Blink cooldown, 50% with level 20 talent).

Justification: Allows Anti-Mage to have a better ""teamfight"" presense option if needed. If you don't NEED to fight and are allowed to split push or pickoff, then please it can be definitely ignored. But against some lineups with a lot of pressure you will need to be more active and sometimes show up, that's where this aghs comes in handy. Does it solve all his problems? No, but it definitely will allow him to be more useful to his team, as that is the most complaint the hero gets (and is why he is rarely picked in the pro scene as well).

t3_m539wu,"Add ""Strict Solo Queue Matchmaking"" to unranked MM.","
As many of you probably have already figured, toxic parties are a nightmare to play with for solo players.

I've personally experienced it a lot, and it's rarely ever pleasant to be matched with a 4-stack party. I know this option is avaliable for ranked matchmaking, but I stopped playing ranked games since I don't have time to dedicate to grinding into high ranks.

As an example of what I'm talking about. In my last match, as soon as I joined, I asked the team if I can play mid and highlighted invoker (my main hero).

One of my teammates immediately picked void spirit and took mid on the map, then asked me to play safelane. As soon as I picked MK, he moved from mid to off, and sent lion into midlane against a Medusa.

The game started, my support ogre barely entered the lane, and I was up against elder and Lina in offlane, pretty cancer, I died two times to their stuns, then I placed a ward in their lane and cleared waves / jungled. Finished maelstrom agha and went pushing, got my game under control.

In the meantime, lion had miserably lost mid to Medusa, who was now very fat (manta mkb mael at min 20), and void+bb lost top to wk and es. Wk had blink+radiance+armlet at that time.

After they started giving up on the game, they all went jungle and spammed their nukes, this was when I started to get triggered as they were blaming me for not having enough farm while wiping jungles and lane creeps as soon as they appear.

I somehow then managed to win those potatoes a few fights by ulting on a tree and stunning them (I know it's pathetic but I'd die in a millisecond if I don't), if they catch me I pop bkb, kill wounded enemies and run away before bkb expires. 

No matter what I tried to do though, they kept dying stupid deaths and eventually I got so incredibly outfarmed that there was nothing I could do. 

they spent the next 10 mins blaming and harassing me, they knew that it's their fault, but why take responsibility if you can just blame the stranger. 
I muted them and they started spamming hate comments on my steam profile after the game etc. etc. 

My point is, these kind of things happen a LOT, it's not just an occurrence, if I suffer from this, then other solo players probably also suffer from it. Games with toxic 4-stacks are absolutely unbearable, and ruin the experience, they just fuck over whoever gets matched with them, then proceed to harass them when they lose.

When I get matched with solo players, they're usually friendly people trying to have fun, occasionally someone is toxic, but that's not really an issue, since other players will look objectively at the flamer, and not focus the blame on one guy. Generally though, games with only solo queues are usually very pleasant, everyone plays their role and tries to have fun.

I realize that having strict solo matchmaking would mean more waiting time, but whoever doesn't want to use it is free to leave it unticked. 

I play with a party sometimes too, but we try to have fun and don't really care about someone playing badly or so, let alone someone who played well but gets blamed anyway. 

TL;DR. Parties ruin games for solo players. They fuck over strangers in their team to do whatever they want, then circlejerk and harass people who were unfortunate enough to be matched with them, making their game a nightmare. Thus, I suggest that devs add an option to strict solo queue for solo players in unranked too.",DotA2

t3_m57fn6,Lack of a proper Co-op vs AI mode hurts the new player experience,"Where else are new players supposed to learn in a fun and safe and non-toxic environment? Queues in co-op vs bots are so long the mode is dead.

I introduced a friend to Dota and my friend has been getting stomped in turbo and unranked non-stop over and over. She is also forced to play supports rather than cores every game because her last hitting and farming sucks, but playing a support and getting deleted in 0.01 second every fight because everyone else in the game has 5x her networth isn't really fun.

As a core she gets more farm and survives slightly longer so it's a bit more fun for her, but can you imagine being the worst player on the team and playing core causing the team to lose every game?

This is Dota's plan for new player retention?

As far as I know, in both League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm, vs AI is the most popular mode (and in most other games too vs AI is significantly more popular than PvP because there are so many casuals who don't care about competition, they just wanna chill, click some buttons and buy pretty skins). So Dota must have done something really wrong for the vs AI mode to be this dead right?

I mean I guess she could play the tutorial over and over or play against nobody in the demo mode... but if those are really the only other options then it's no wonder League of Legends is more popular than Dota",DotA2

- Account age + hours played, to ensure it's not a throwaway

- In-game dota metadata stats to use as variables, like behavior score, number of overwatch cases done/reported, last time a game was played, etc.

t3_m52iy8,Gamejitsu's replay analysis coaching platform is now live!,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fuenachxr1n61.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52b07ca834ec3711b2b0a4af457a9d07ca448a0c

Ever since Dota 2 launched, **coaching** had been prominent over the internet due to the ability to spectate games and download replays on a whim. Two 2k MMR Italian players, who played the game regularly together, sought improvements in their gameplay and started to consult coaches for coaching sessions.

However, the Italians soon found various issues with improving with existing coaching methodologies:

* Live coaching was too distracting, having to juggle between playing and listening to the coach giving advice at the same time, affecting performance and therefore coaching quality. ^((Or maybe because the Italians are just bad at conversing in English, who knows))
* Written guides are too generic and may be outdated. ^(You can't buy Iron Talon anymore even if the guide wants you to do so.)
* Non-live video analysis is great, but takes a lot of effort to both record the video (By the coach) and to watch the full game video (By the player). Applies to talking over a replay too with streaming. ^(People rather spend 50 minutes watching 5 Dota WTF videos than 30 minutes watching their own replay.) 
* Watching pro games or pro video guides are great but the game tips may not be exactly relevant to the player's MMR range. ^(In our games, our lane partner is very often a Pudge (please stop), not some high MMR heroes like a Bane.)
* Of course, physical live coaching is the best, ^(but you obviously don't get that everyday considering my 6k MMR housemate decided to move out after seeing me missing 3 Shadowrazes in 2 seconds.)

# Hence, the Italians, now being two 5k MMR scrubs, created their first iteration of Gamejitsu.

What is **Gamejitsu**, and how does it differ from the usual VoIP live coaching?

[Although the picture doesn't include text formatting, we did have it implemented.](https://preview.redd.it/6tg6yf4tm1n61.jpg?width=3711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c5557eec70a2e55dd9ce3c4b5bb54d0099f992)

Gamejitsu combines a video analysis system with written coaching. That way, the users can read in detail about their mistakes, tips for improvements, every exact moment of them missing their Pudge hooks and other game advice in clear view. The user can also click on each comment to fast forward immediately to the time frame where the mistake or whatever the coach wants to talk about happened, saving time compared to watching a full video or replay.

For shy users, Gamejitsu also eliminates direct conversation with coaches, negating issues such as voice slangs or language barriers in VoIP coaching.

[We plan to include more details such as game scoreboards that you can view with Dotabuff \/ Opendota etc.](https://preview.redd.it/brk8a32rn1n61.jpg?width=3711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfcf445a9f1fb2e566b2bf0066a72641b66db4f7)

Not much to talk about the user dashboard aside from convenience, users can login with their Steam account and immediately see replays that currently have replays available for review. (Replays in Dota 2 expires in 1-2 weeks)

Once you pick a replay for review, you can then choose the levels of coaches reviewing your game. Our system also automatically records the replay into a video form for you, which will then be sent to the coach for review. You can go back and watch the reviewed game anytime you want.

[The price is for reference only in this picture. Refer to the website for accurate pricing.](https://preview.redd.it/z9tms8kjo1n61.jpg?width=3711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c57c1c61319be07634f12343d059f986647b83ee)

Of course, coaches are providing services, and we want to ensure they are well paid to coach players happily. However, we want users to choose the levels of coaching they need / can afford. A 2k MMR player probably doesn't want to learn how and when to creepskip, they just want to know how to style on everyone with their Bloodseeker quick.

[We had extensive talks and tryouts with coaches, but we aim to keep them minimal to demand so they can stay healthy financially and on workload too.](https://preview.redd.it/7yv6z45zp1n61.jpg?width=3711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b836153db376289be3b17764c09766789b546b7)

Of course, in the near future, we would include a diverse range of coaches on board based on experience and language too. For now, our coaches range between 5k to 8k+ MMR. All of them participated in tournaments (and won some of them), casting and coaching experience, at least one of them.

[This is an example of content creation: Recommended starting item set for offlane Legion Commander by Kazami, a 7k MMR coach + dirty Legion spammer.](https://preview.redd.it/ek2bx7poq1n61.jpg?width=3716&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b27d2d6daaaeeaffbec9e04b9dd8a18357228a4)

Lastly, we understand that not everyone will be interested in paid coaching. We still want our coaches to stay professional and up-to-date with game knowledge, and we release content guides to the public approx. every Thursday on Dota 2 subreddits. Some of our coaches, such as Arthur and Otomo, work both as casters and content creators. We want users to enjoy or even provide constructive feedback for their content, so our coaches can stay motivated in the MMR grind.

# For you guys interested in trying out our system directly, visit [https://gamejitsu.gg/demo](https://gamejitsu.gg/demo) for a live demo.

We believe Dota 2 is far from dead, and since we love the game, we hope to start the system from the game we enjoy. However, we do have plans to expand to other games after perfecting our system.",DotA2
