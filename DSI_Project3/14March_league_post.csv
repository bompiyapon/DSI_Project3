t3_m49dx5,"Ziggs is practically obsolete, with only a 0.8% pick-rate. To make him meta again, I propose replacing his character model with an anime girl. Introducing Kled and Zigg's adoptive daughter: KLEEGS, the Hexplosive Expert","Updated bio: Kleegs is the adopted daughter of Kled and Ziggs. She takes after Ziggs a lot more though, since Kled left to ""go buy some milk"" 2 days after her adoption. She wears a smaller version of Zigg's goggles and throws the same bombs as him to attack. Her hat is a legendary magic-resistant item known as the Adoptive Helm.

Essentially, this is a VGU that changes Zigg's character model to Kleeg's. The same is done for all his/her skins. Her abilities and stats are exactly the same as Ziggs, but since she's an anime girl, she will sell many skins and will be forced to be meta.

Although Ziggs will no longer be in the game, he'll live on as a character in the lore, until he dies a tragic death to further Kleeg's character development. Thank you.

t3_m4k4px,LEC Week 8 Day 3: Who you should be rooting for (based on your team),"Based on your team of choice, you can find your viewer's guide for the last five games of LEC Spring 2021 below. The data is taken from the LEC foldy sheet, found [here](https://lec.gg/foldy-sheet).

The day's breather game is **Game 3 _(AST vs MAD)_**, as it has no impact on any team's standings. MAD are already locked into 3rd, and AST are already locked into 9th. Hope for an appropriate fiesta here.

For the other four games (of which Every Game Counts), refer to your team name below.

---

# Kings, Legacies, Dynasties (1st/2nd place)

## G2 Esports (G2)
* **Game 1 – Game 3:** Relax and watch the fireworks.
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** Bite your nails and hope your boys don't run it down. If you win, you lock first place.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** If your boys did run it down in Game 4, you are now rooting for FNC. If FNC wins, you place first. Otherwise, you place second.

## Rogue (RGE)
* **Game 1 – Game 3:** Relax and watch the fireworks.
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** You are rooting for SK. If G2 win, they lock first place, and you locks second.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** If you win here, and SK won in Game 4, you place first. Otherwise, you place second.

# The already-locked (3rd, 9th, 10th place)

## Astralis (AST) / Team Vitality (VIT)
* **Game 1 – Game 5:** _Spend all day with a big bag of popcorn, weeping silently. You are locked into 9th and 10th place respectively._

## MAD Lions (MAD)
* **Game 1 – Game 5:** _Share the popcorn of the AST/VIT fan, while comforting them as they weep silently. You are locked into 3rd place._

# The remaining Charlie Foxtrot (4th–8th place)

## Fnatic (FNC)
* **Game 1 _(MSF vs VIT)_:** This is your first opportunity to bury your worst nightmares – you're rooting for VIT. If they win, you are guaranteed playoffs.
* **Game 2 _(XL  vs S04)_:** You're rooting for XL. If they win, you either lock 4th place (if VIT won) or guarantee playoffs (if MSF won). If you are locked into 4th, your adventure ends here.  
_(The below assumes you are not locked into 4th.)_
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** This is a tricky one:
  * __VIT won Game 1 and S04 won Game 2:__ You are rooting for SK, because their win locks you into 4th. If G2 wins, you would place 5th if you lose Game 5.
  * __MSF won Game 1 and S04 won Game 2:__ You are the biggest G2 fan on the face of Runeterra. If SK wins, all your nightmares coagulate, and you miss playoffs if you lose Game 5.
  * __MSF won Game 1 and XL won Game 2:__ You aren't all that invested. You will place 5th/6th if you lose Game 5, no matter who wins here.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** A FNC win makes all of your previous nail-biting pointless, and you lock 4th place no matter what. If you went 0-3 on the week, see above for your result.


## FC Schalke 04 (S04)
* **Game 1 _(MSF vs VIT)_:** This has no impact on your _playoff_ chances. If you're optimistic to a fault, a VIT win would keep the possibility of _4th place_ alive.
* **Game 2 _(XL  vs S04)_:** This is your must-win game. If you lose, you lock 8th, and your adventure ends here. If you win, you are guaranteed playoffs, and are locked into 5th/6th if MSF won.  
_(The below assumes a S04 win.)_
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** If VIT won their game, you are rooting for G2 to keep the chance of 4th place alive.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** If both VIT and G2 won, you're rooting for RGE. If all three of VIT, G2, and RGE win their games, you have miraculously made it into 4th place.

## Misfits (MSF)
* **Game 1 _(MSF vs VIT)_:** This is your must-win game. If you lose, you are locked into 7th place, and your adventure stops here.  
_(The below assumes a MSF win.)_
* **Game 2 _(XL  vs S04)_:** You're rooting for XL. If they win, you guarantee playoffs.
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** If XL didn't guarantee you playoffs before, you're rooting for G2 here. If they win, you also guarantee playoffs.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** You are the biggest RGE fan on the face of Runeterra.
  * If RGE wins, you are guaranteed 4th place.
  * If RGE lose, and you weren't guaranteed playoffs yet, you place 7th. Otherwise, you place 5th/6th.

## SK Gaming (SK)
* **Game 1 _(MSF vs VIT)_:** You're rooting for VIT, as a VIT win locks you into 5th/6th place. In this case, you can breathe easy, and your adventure stops here.  
_(The below assumes a MSF win.)_
* **Game 2 _(XL  vs S04)_:** Kick back, and try to remain calm. This game has no impact on your standing.
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** Your must-win game. If you win, you lock 5th place. If you lose, you lock 7th place.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** Either relax or continue to sob uncontrollably. You're already locked based on the results of Game 1 and Game 4.

## Excel Esports (XL)
* **Game 1 _(MSF vs VIT)_:** You're rooting for VIT. If VIT wins, then you can guarantee playoffs in the next game. If MSF win, you are in for a nail-biter of a day.
* **Game 2 _(XL  vs S04)_:** Your must-win game. If you lose, you are locked into 8th place. If you win, and VIT won the previous game, you are locked into 6th place. Regardless, your adventure ends here.  
_(The below assumes that both MSF and XL won their games.)_
* **Game 4 _(G2  vs SK)_:** If G2 wins, you lock 6th place. If SK wins, you lock 7th place and miss playoffs.
* **Game 5 _(RGE vs FNC)_:** Either relax or continue to sob uncontrollably. You're already locked based on the previous games' results.

---

# But that's way too much text, can't you give me a one-liner?

* **G2**: Either don't go 0-3, or have RGE lose. Either way, you place first.
* **RGE**: G2 has to lose, you have to win. If both happen, you place first.
* **MAD**: You're already locked into third.
* **FNC**: As long as you don't go 0-3, you place 4th. If you've lost confidence, root for VIT and XL.  
**FNC**: _(If you plan to lose Game 5, refer to the full version for Game 4. It's complicated.)_
* **S04**: Win your game to make playoffs. If you win, and all of VIT/G2/RGE also won, you place 4th.
* **MSF**: Win your game. Afterwards, if one of XL/G2/RGE wins, you make playoffs. If RGE wins, you place 4th.
* **SK**: If VIT wins, you make playoffs. If VIT loses, you must beat G2 to make playoffs.
* **XL**: Win your game. You also need one of VIT/G2 to win.
* **AST**/**VIT**: You're locked into 9th/10th. Try to be a blue shell.

t3_m4g3ir,TLDR: the only scenario for Fnatic to miss playoffs,"This is for everyone who doesn't want to read the foldy sheet!  


FNC will miss playoffs if tomorrow MSF wins, Schalke wins, SK wins AND they lose to Rogue.   


In other words, they still have it in their own hands, they only need to win against Rogue. but imo FNC wont win against Rogue but anything can happen.  


I just think it's super interessting and funny that they need either VIT, XL or, and this one makes it more fun, G2 to win in order to make it to the playoffs without worrying losing to Rogue.  


ALSO! If G2 loses and FNC manages to win, they will help G2 secure the first place xD

t3_m47ql1,What's a mechanic on your main that not many people do or know?,Ok so for example my main is Evelynn and when you hit someone with the first part of the Q the 3 orbs around the champion is actually what does most of her damage.

Depending on ELO, she has anywhere from a 26-40%+ pick rate, anywhere from a 25-40% ban rate, and always above 50% WR going up as you go higher (and keep in mind this is with an absurd pick rate, so her real winrate is much higher).

The champ lacks any significant kit-inherent weakness, and has too many tools and options available. -10 damage on an ability that hits for several hundred is not enough to fix her, and calling it a nerf is laughable.

And she has no nerfs on the PBE as of now.",leagueoflegends

t3_m4cfo1,Day in the Life of an Adult Diamond Solo Queuer,"You wake up, it's 5:00 AM. You take your roommate to work and drive back to your apartment.

You brush your teeth, you drink some water because it's way too damn early to eat.

You decide you'll grind a few ranked games before work to finally climb up to Masters.

The queue starts, it's **5:35 AM**, with an estimated time of 5 minutes. You wait 8 minutes.

You get into a champion select, you're **autofilled.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's jungle, your worst role. you ask if someone else can take it instead. Nope, there are three mid mains on your team, so you wait to see if someone will dodge.

No one does, so you dodge. It's been **12 minutes** without a game.

You wait 5 minutes to queue up again. You queue up.

You get into a game after only 2 minutes this time, what a steal! You're mid.

Before bans are even placed, toplane says *'Oh god, not this jungle again.'*

They flame eachother. One picks Zilean and says he's going to run it down mid.

&amp;#x200B;

You've already dodged, but it's still worth it to lose your hard-earned LP instead of your even harder earned hidden MMR. You wait to see if someone else will dodge. Someone does with 5 seconds left.

It's now been **22 minutes** without a game.

You queue up again, making sure to leave the previous queue. It's now **5:57 AM.**

You get into a game after 4 minutes. Everything seems fine, you [OP.GG](https://OP.GG) just in case to make sure no one is intentionally feeding every one of their games.

Your jungle has a 43% winrate with 300 games.

It's fine, you've dodged already you think this game he'll finally pull back, he's already on a 3 game winstreak anyways right?

&amp;#x200B;

You finally get into game, it's now **6:01 AM.**

You play hard and make good decisions, this is a quality game. You make sure to track the enemy jungle and ward properly for your jungle.

Your jungle dies ganking top. The top was already 2/0.

He goes top a second time. This is the hand you're dealt, you will carry this game regardless.

He goes top a third time, the enemy top was already 5/0. (Yes this still happens in Diamond)

Your top is tilted beyond belief and decides to afk at his tower for the rest of the game.

You lose, you've lost 20 lp(also, you only gain 13 even though you have a 60% winrate).

&amp;#x200B;

Unlucky game, you'll continue playing.

It's now **6:42 AM**, work starts in about three hours. That should be like.. one and a half more games?

You've got this, at this rate you'll make Master in no time.",leagueoflegends
t3_m4n75p,Every time I come back to League the community reminds why I left,"Nothing ever gets done about griefers and trolls. People just ruin game after game and nothing ever happens. Just had a Samira support run it for 30 minutes straight while everyone else tried to win. We actually started to get close to winning despite her so she ran it even harder to make sure we lost. She's done this for her last 15 ranked games or so. 

Nothing will ever happen, though. 

I want to play League, I really enjoy the game when everyone tries their best and keeps a positive attitude. But I can't keep putting myself through the torture that is solo queue. It's to the point where 1/10 games are actually enjoyable. The rest are full of flaming, griefing, and babysitting. I just want to play the game, I don't want to deal with the community anymore. I'll go back to watching LCS and playing other games. It's just too torturous to play this game if you care about it at all.",leagueoflegends

t3_m4q23s,Amazing chat idea to reduce toxicity and reduced team whining,"Many players go into ranked and turn off chat right when the game starts. Meteos does this i think

I don't have a problem with this but I find it annoying if I'm typing to my jungler in a friendly way about something important such as i dont care about getting ganks and im fine with him helping other lanes instead.  and they don't reply and I wonder if their chat is off or is he ignoring me .. and I stop typing after a while once i realize hes mute.. but still it would be nice to know which it is


I think a cool easy feature to add would be a little chat indicator next to your teammates when you press Tab . If it's green it means they have chat turned on and if it's red it means they have chat turned off .... so easily you can see if a teammate of yours intentionallty clicked this button to turn off their chat.... and also it will be a very easy way for people to press this button and let their team know their chat is turned off and they are focusing on game instead of typing

I think if this features added it would quickly create sort of a type of evolutionary natural selection effect where people would quickly learn that if they turned off their chat immediately at the first sign of anyone showing toxic energy on their team that it would have increased their win rate and cause them to win games if they would have lost if people on the team kept typing

I think eventually it would create a system-wide effect where everyone would realize oh wow if i just turn off chat it increases my win rate.. eventually everyone will start turning off their chat the moment anyone gets toxic .. And this would create a much more chill ranked experience because it would remove toxic people's ability to even be toxic in the first place because everyone will just be turning off their chats when he gets toxic

 And then any people who dont turn off their chat at signs of a toxic team would quickly see them having a lower win rate. So everyone would start doing it once they realize it creates a higher win rate",leagueoflegends

t3_m4fz7z,Jungle has become so unhealthy for both teammates and players,"I'm not sure how jungle was ""overtuned"" in these last set of nerfs but here we are.  90% of my games i've got an auto-filled jungler burning up from the flame of team-mates.


___THE CHAMPS_____

You're basically either playing
Graves
Hecarim
Nunu
*note:  High-elo gets the pleasure of Udry,Karthus and Shaco.

Anything else is considered not efficent or in my soloq teams words ""trolling"".

It's felt this way for the entire season. I really miss variety of champs in my game.  Sure YOU CAN PLAY ANYTHING, but it's definitly not as strong the meta and it's not strong by a mile.


____REASONING_______

The debate that I personally have gotten is that Jungle has to much impact on other lanes.  But isn't that what's its supposed to do?  Nerfing camps just makes scaling junglers absolutely worthless early-mid and by then it's gg or your team couldn't survive the early-mid without a jungle presence.  

___AUTO FILL______

Nobody wants to play the role because if you make a mistake you're out of the game for atleast 4-5 minutes while you attempt to catch up or you're just out entirely.  Thus you have a bunch of players who don't play jungle to either A go up against someone who does jungle or B  hope for the best.  How is that fair?   Jungle is a role that you need to spend time in.  But no one wants to spend time in it if it's literal suffering and non-stop flame whenever something doesn't go right.


_____GIT GUD_______

I'm not a jungle main, but from the outside looking in I""ve stopped getting upset when my jungle is struggling to do basic mechanics, clears, or skirmishes.  They've got a lot on their plate and everyone is out to get ya.  Whenever I get auto-filled to jungle its an instant ""/mute all"" which seems counter-productive when we're trying to communicate as a team, but as soon as it goes downhill it goes downhill real fast.

This is just what I've noticed from about 200-300 games of Gold-Plat elo.  Anything lower is probably the wild west where animals roam free.

They tried to ff-15 and I (pantheon) voted no because I thought it was a troll surrender vote, but then my entire team actually voted yes and got super pissed at me for wanting to keep playing. Camille started trolling, and they tried to open mid before overruling my no vote at 20 minutes.

We were the left side. Enemy mid was useless, their top was ahead, I was on par with yi, and we had a *6/1 kai'sa* at 15 minutes. I'm so confused.

Games don't last long enough for scaling champs to outpace early game losses. Comebacks are also fewer and further in between, making the sort of toxic behavior like running it down even more justified, since it ends the game faster.

I'm not saying that this kind of behavior should be accepted. It shouldn't. But the direction Rito is taking the game in is reinforcing the paper mental mindset and it's really unhealthy for anything short of pro play.",leagueoflegends

t3_m45mfh,League of Legends Builds Optimizer Web Engine and Guides,"I've fed League of Legends into my PhD work. I've got automatically generated builds for all champions in all roles.

&amp;#x200B;

It's based on the raw maths of the champions, items and runes. It can find the theoretical optimal build even if no one has ever played it before. It takes account of runes, champion actives, champion passives, item actives, item passives, burst damage, sustain damage, cooldown reduction, gap closing and most of the behind the scenes formulas in lol.

&amp;#x200B;

You can select the champion, the build (set of stats to optimize for), and then vary the ratios between those stats.

&amp;#x200B;

It will show you the build order that corresponds to those settings.

&amp;#x200B;

**New Stuff:**

&amp;#x200B;

You can now force/ban runes and items and change all of the engine settings under ""Engine Options"". The engine will then run in your web browser and change the build to match your new settings. See the yellow bar for progress.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you want a different keystone, want a different mythic or you want to ban an item, you can now do that. You can also change most of the engine settings under Engine Options.

&amp;#x200B;

You can create and publish guides that contain all of the changes you made to the builds alongs with the standard guide text.

&amp;#x200B;

People can then view your guides and even edit the builds, say to add Seeker's Armguard, Quicksilver Sash or Grevious Wounds (listed under force items) to the build and the build will will reoptimize itself with those new changes.

t3_m46932,I think it's time we have a serious discussion about the hitboxes in this game,"This is nothing new at this point but for a game like League which takes so much **pride in the clarity of its champions and spells** ([as the newest developer post suggest](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/clarity-in-league/)) its a **shame that so many of its hitboxes feel so misleading**.

There are countless examples of videos, screenshots, clips and so on of hooks which shouldn't have landed in a 1000 years and yet, for really convoluted reasons they do. **Some rioters were quoted saying that the hitboxes in this game were designed to benefit the «aggressor» and not the «victim»** which I believe is a fair and healthy gameplay design decision but the execution of this decision, imo, really hinders the clarity of the game and therefore the counter play afforded to the «victim».

This is **specially worrisome when it comes to hooks** since they are by design a **low risk high reward ability** which can win or lose a lane. To lose lane because of a poorly coded hitbox which you know you dodged has to be one of the shittiest experiences you can have in League and sadly this seems to happen way to often.

I'm gonna post the inciting hook which made me post this ramble bellow. Because Riot believes that a lollipopping hitbox is a fine design decision **I get hooked despite the 2 golden rules of avoiding a hook, 1: avoid the visual indicator, and 2:  stand behind your minions.**

t3_m4gqz3,Syndra's Narrative Direction In Lore.,"This is a somewhat lengthy and extensive discussion about Syndra; how she exists in the current narrative, how she existed in the past, and the role she was intended to fill.  As such it delves into several aspects of her history both in lore itself, as well as with the community.

For ease of navigation, I've laid out the main talking points below, please feel free to (ctrl+F) to go to sections that interest you.

1. SYNDRA’S NARRATIVE
2. CRITICISMS OF THE CURRENT BIOGRAPHY
3. WHAT DOES SHE HAVE NOW?
4. RECTIFYING ISSUES AND EXPANDING STORIES

There are critiques of Syndra's narrative, this is however not meant to be a negative analysis, there is always hope at the end, and several avenues lie open for Syndra.  If you wish to wholly avoid criticisms, stick to 1 and 4.

*\[For clarification, ""hypocrisy"" in ideals of regions is something that Riot is intentionally using as a story method.  It is seen in Demacia, who idealizes unity.  It is seen in Noxus, who proclaims ""Everyone is accepted"".   There are caveats for all.   It is a method used to explore a region's themes and a commentary on its past and its future.\]*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Syndra's Narrative

Imagine being forgotten as a person, but for your name to be remembered as a word meaning “destruction” and “giving in to your pains and fears”.

From this, it is heavily implied that it was known Syndra’s life was rough and troubled.  Yet instead of being used as a parable, or a lesson to prevent a repeat of events, rather than being used to teach a society to be better, it is cursed throughout the provinces.

And guess what? That’s *normalized*.

This is an issue with society in general, not just Runeterra.  It manifests in mental health and how it was perceived, it manifests in how we teach our children, it manifests in how we handle our criminals.

Rather than reform being pushed, and understanding the root of the issue, people are content with locking them up, ignoring them, or getting rid of them while doing nothing to try and make sure it doesn’t happen again with the future generations.

&amp;#x200B;

**We ignore the context of what leads to things happening**.

&amp;#x200B;

For Syndra, we see a case of a child prone to distraction being bullied by her brother and his friends, scolded harshly by her mother at every turn, and blamed for all misfortunes that befell the family, no matter how incongruent.  We see a girl blessed with power beyond measure, turned to chaos with little control.

She’s entrusted to a teacher, an Elder, to gain control over her abilities.  She puts her all into training, trying to be better, yet over time, instead of dedicating more and more effort into guiding Syndra, her teacher withdraws more and more, until we eventually learn he’s been attempting to restrain her power.

Confronting him, Syndra eventually unleashes her pent up rage, frustration, and betrayal, killing him, before lashing out at the world itself.

&amp;#x200B;

From here we know the spirit of Ionia silenced her tantrum and put her in timeout.  But this story mirrors another story prevalent to Ionia, and references a hypocrisy in the ideal they espouse, and the traditions practices.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vastaya.

&amp;#x200B;

An ancient race whose survival hinges on magic being prevalent in the environment, nowadays in Ionia the vastaya are facing potential extinction.  All due to the presence, and overabundance, of Quinlons.  Magical “dams'' , meant to stymie and filter the flows of magic into Ionia via the spirit realm.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, the Quinlons were deemed necessary, as raw unchecked spirit magic flowing into the physical realm can have unpredictable effects upon reality, making it potentially dangerous for mortals.  As such, deals were negotiated and compromises reached.

However, growing complacent, mortals started believing it was their right to populate Ionia and restrict the magics more and more, so they could have increasing comforts, and quality of life… at the expense of the Vastaya.  Over time, this behavior has been allowed to persist, in part due to the vastaya relenting and allowing it, until now.

&amp;#x200B;

***So where is this hypocrisy?***

&amp;#x200B;

Ionia preaches an Ideal of Balance: Living in harmony with the land and the realm of spirits beyond.Yet in practice, instead of truly upholding this ideal, they restrict the natural flows of magic so that they might live in comfort, rather than truly living in harmony (and compromise) with the lands.

In a region meant to embody spiritual peace, harmony, and enlightenment, instead repression and restriction is practiced.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Syndra’s theme?**

What is the main wrong that she encountered while trying to handle her powers better? What is something that happens irl with kids with ADD and other neurodivergencies? What happens to those kids who are deemed mentally gifted, but whose schools and societies see fit to stagnate and hold back?

Ionia’s ideal is balance, yet when we look, we see restraint... we see people content to bending and holding back the world rather than working with it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is part of why I’d hate for her to go down as “just a villain”.

&amp;#x200B;

Syndra should definitely serve as an antagonistic force for Ionia.  This however does not mean she should be “evil”, nor dedicated solely to “anarchy and dissent”.  She should be an antagonistic force to Ionia’s detrimental traditions.

As such, Syndra should have an arc that results in influencing Ionia’s society and political landscape, serving in contrast to her peers as she’s an example of where Ionia’s traditions *failed.*

To that end, I think she should serve as another faction, eventually becoming an Elder, rather than her story being about, and culminating in, her defeat/death.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not saying the reactions of the Ionians make zero sense.  It’s easier to blame and sweep aside, rather than target and focus on the roots of the issue.  Easier to ignore once it no longer seems relevant, than strive to seek reform… particularly if it was deemed an oddity.  I’m saying that her story is a waste and sets a bad tone if it’s not built upon in a way that doesn’t culminate in her just being “another villain”.

&amp;#x200B;

**It’s a story that speaks to Ionia’s hypocrisy in its theme.**   
One that serves as a way to fight against that tradition and provide corrections.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t to say Syndra was truly right in her actions, nor should they be glossed over.  She shouldn’t suddenly be made to turn an altruistic leaf.  She very much is someone entrenched in riotous emotions, many negative.  She should be bitter with Ionia; both towards its people, and the land/spirit itself.  However she should grow with it to recognize both its shortcomings, as well as hers herself.

In service to that end, I believe it is important that an element of justification is provided for Syndra’s past.  Something to contextualize her interaction with Konnigen, the Elder meant to be teacher.  And in this, we must address the issues Syndra currently has.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Criticisms of The Current Biography

With Syndra’s edits, and subsequent long form story (The Dreaming Pool is not a color story, to be clear) several criticisms were raised, many of which were valid.

Old lore presented a character who existed beyond feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger.  This Syndra was a resolute woman: strong, motivated, driven, and self-assured.  She was someone who recognized, and wholeheartedly embraced, her potential.  While she didn’t have a presence in lore, or connection to the world beyond that, one could rest assured knowing what Syndra’s general mindset was.

***Put a pin on that.***

Current Syndra, however, has become someone so thrown around by outside forces: bullied by her family, ousted by her village, neglected by her teacher, betrayed by that same man, and locked in an endless dream by the Spirit of Ionia itself.  Upon awakening, she was placed in a similar scenario she was in prior to the update; a character with no connections… this time however, she was also a character with no known mindset beyond anger, bitterness, and betrayal.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t really a personality.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, it felt like little was added that wasn’t already presumed (as many believed her life was likely rough prior to coming to the temple), with things actually being taken *away.*  Thus, disappointment in regards to this was expressed, and with no color story, little can be done to alleviate those concerns other than to hope and wait.

As a result of this however, people who hadn't read her original lore are presented with a woman of intense power, and anger, who was thrown around, then left.  Several new people think she straight up left Ionia, and are lost as to what she is doing or who she is.

&amp;#x200B;

Irritation with the story (*The Dreaming Pool*) to me seemed largely as a criticism of her powers being changed (which has since been clarified to be a misunderstanding of leech vs leach), but more so an extension of the issues with the biography, namely it removing aspects that were integral to Syndra’s character, and leaving her in a similar vacuum.

&amp;#x200B;

There was also another instance of misinterpretation, as many people thought *""The Dreaming Pool""* was her color story...something which is meant to be a snapshot of the character.  Thus when so little of it was actually from Syndra's PoV, and none of it expanded upon her current goal, it makes the indignation more understandable.  Especially when paired with the thought that an update to Syndra would result in her actually being connected to the world, and provided a clear plot.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, this is not justifying all of the reactions, as there were many that went overboard while voicing their grievances (mostly due to that misunderstanding of color vs region story and the circumstances of her biography.)

Writers are aware of the concerns, with the author of The Dreaming Pool having expressed sympathy and understanding, but also saying it was out of his hands as he’d not done the bio.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# What Does She Have Now?

Syndra, at the moment, is a character who lacks purpose, direction, and agency.  Objectively from the bio and story, what is there that she really does have?

She doesn't have a place in the world atm, we don't know what she'll be doing, we have more info about her past (which was nice) but at the same time the only reference we got to her having motivation/agency of her own was when she:

1. Threw herself into her studies, yet still failed at controlling her powers.
2. Killed her master after feeling betrayed despite him trying to calm her down, and him trying to give an explanation as to why it was necessary... one that actually does make sense.

It makes Syndra's reactions feel like an overreaction rather than having been justified on her part...while at the same time justifying Konnigen's actions (trying to dampen her powers).  This is why it reads as a temper tantrum rather than something I can truly say was justified, whereas old bio had that nuance.

&amp;#x200B;

She’s a girl who should be frustrated with herself, and her past, who is lashing out at the world.

&amp;#x200B;

There's no hint to her liking her powers, no hint of actual growth, yet several pointing to them being a nuisance to both her, and those around her.

She becomes a character so entrenched in the negative, that it’s easy to think that’s all she is:

Doomed.

&amp;#x200B;

The third instance of any hint to agency was when she expressed she’d no longer be bound by someone else and left with no hint as to a goal or intent in mind.

So it's like... what does she really have? Power, disconnection, and undirected anger?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a criticism of what we currently have, for a character whose update is incomplete, yet writers have expressed she's not really in any priority.  So yes, she is crippled at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Rectifying Issues and Expanding Stories

As said before, Syndra’s interaction with Konnigen reads as a tantrum because it’s just pent up frustration being compounded upon and explosively released while someone is trying to calm her down.

It’s a situation where she’s lashing out due to those frustrations, rather than lashing out in any form of self defense.

While this can be an interesting plot route... with zero goal or direction for her it places her more in the role of a petulant child rather than someone who has been slighted at every turn.

This is in large part specifically due to Konnigen being pushed to the “epitome” of a sympathetic character, and removing the nuance of the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

To fix this, show what Konnigen’s absence resulted in for Syndra, show her struggling to get better and even having small successes in her endeavors.  Give us a reason for her to have come to accept her powers as part of herself, something that lightens that overall negative association with her powers, then show her growing helplessness as Konnigen retreats in attempts to dampen her powers, rather than directly help her…

Even show that Konnigen messing with her magic might’ve contributed to the flare ups being worse, causing her to lose control as he tries to wrest her power from her grasp and dampen it.

At that point you don’t even need to re-add the elements of a threat.

It’d also actively tie back into Ionia’s idyllic hypocrisy.

&amp;#x200B;

***Ultimately, both she and Konnigen should be in the wrong.  But for the right reasons.***

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that pin we'd placed?  It should be noted that what we have now is almost an inversion of scenarios: We know Syndra's past, and what lead to her becoming Konnigen's pupil.  We don't know her current personality, nor have a stable grasp on where she's going.  This however does allow for new explorations within stories.  I particularly hope this becomes prevalent within her color story, of which I hope to be an introspective piece, more-so than a story meant to be about showing her power.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While studying under Konnigen, I think Syndra may have been somewhat bitter about the past, but came to have accepted it and moved on.  As seen in the biography, she’d taken the lessons about tempering her emotions to heart and threw her all into it.  And while I definitely think these emotions still seeped through (as Konnigen claimed it was affecting the world), had Konnigen delved further into helping her rather than trying to restrain and suppress her power (thereby neglecting her…) I’m sure events would’ve ended up differently.

The Justicar skin was originally meant to be testament to that.

&amp;#x200B;

What Konnigen did is understandable; he did what he thought was best to do based on circumstances present.  He was out of his depth, and likely stuck in a traditional mindset, rather than trying to adapt a new one.  I think this is likely especially given the context of Ionia and the underlying themes that are being set up.

It should be established, however, that despite his attempts to do right, his methods were inherently wrong and potentially actively contributed to how volatile Syndra’s powers were.

&amp;#x200B;

If it turns out that what he did had zero impact on the volatility of her power despite the fact that she was honestly trying, I hate the message it sends.

She’d be presented as inherently negative.

Doomed

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a shit message to send on a meta level for those who experienced similar situations.  Especially if it culminates in her just being a villain.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As such, let her be a symbol of hope, the chance for new growth after a forest-fire, and a rebirth for Ionia.",leagueoflegends

Why is it that every enemy ezreal is a SKT backup player, while every ezreal we have is an actual dog drooling on the keyboard?

&amp;#x200B;

I've played a few dozen games in the past weeks and every enemy ezreal is a massive threat always dumpster diving through my botlaners until he's nice and juiced at one time even 1v2'd when his support was afk he went 7/0 that game before we surrendered.

&amp;#x200B;

But when we have an ezreal he can barely manage to collect 2-3 cs per wave before getting pushed out of lane by the solo ad yuumi.

I'm seriously getting to a point where I want to remove it from my PC, but I love playing and know I would miss having a way to regularly (virtually) hang out with my friends.

t3_m488de,How does Overgrowth work?,"Just a quick question about overgrowth rune - After gaining 15 stacks (120 monsters or minions), you gain an additional 3.5% Health maximum health.

&amp;#x200B;

Does the 3.5% additional health scale? So as you gain more hp through the game, it recalculates the 3.5% and adds that?

To clarify, lets say you get the 15 stacks and your health is 1000 - you gain the 3.5%. Then you go into the shop and buy item with 350 health. Does it then recalculate 3.5% of 1350 and add that new value? (I don't mean stacking it with previous one, but just recalculating value of 3.5% as health changes)

If its a one time thing based on your current health at the time, does that mean you should buy as much hp before the 15th stack?",leagueoflegends

This is relatively consistent across the game, except for Rell, who has a deceptively long knockup on her W for some reason.","Rell's W apparently knockups for 1 second, which is the same duration as Alistar Q, but think about it. Alistar sends people super high in the air with his Q, but Rell W does a small bump and the target is back on the ground but still can't move because they are technically ""airborne"" still. This is super confusing to watch and play against, you land on the ground and believe you can move but you can't. I mean look at it https://youtu.be/BLN6TVu3vUs?t=96, Vayne is on the ground but still ""airborne""??? Compare it to Alistar Q https://youtu.be/rq2LkNAL05U?t=22, pretty much as soon as Lucian is on the ground he can move again, and he went so much higher for the equal duration knockup. If Rell W is supposed to knockup for 1 second, it should send people as high as Alistar Q does because it's the same duration. I would be willing to bet that if Rell W was changed to actually be consistent with how knockups work and we had her launching people as high as they should go for a 1 second knockup, people would realise how broken her W is and she would be nerfed within a patch. Currently her W makes it look like a mini knockup for a fraction of a second but it's not. Lack of clarity is likely a large factor into why Rell is currently so strong, she CC's people for much longer than they believe to be.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3m80g,The Problem With the New Items isn't that they are not diverse. It's that there are too few of them.,"There has been plenty of talk here about build diversity recently and the number of items is something that has not been given enough attention. When you open the shop, it seems like there are plenty of items... until you realise like half of them are mythic of which you can only build one.

For example, if you are a support, you have to choose between 8-ish items for your 6 item build regardless of which of all the supports in the game you have picked. And how is that problem 'solved'. By just not letting supports get full build by almost completely removing their gold income after 1k...

Furthermore, there aren't enough item synergies, probably due to the low number of items as well. Items that would work well with each other are often both mythics and therefore you can't have them in the same build.

In conclusion, I think that Riot hasn't necessarily 'failed' the item rework, and in fact it can be fixed in a relatively simple way: just add more items that do more things (and by that I don't mean more extreme stuff like cc, dashes or zhonya, just old-school style items)",leagueoflegends

t3_m4lmon,Let's talk AD akali. (And maybe Hybrid),"Before Akali's rework, and before the new item rework, Akali was quite often played Hybrid. (At least I did). This was back during the days when everything goes as akali. (Heck, I still remember the glorious days of full tank akali with sunfire cape in top lane.. Even Garen was was left pouting at the tower. )   


After her first initial rework, she went full AP, (not counting hextech gunblade). This was because due to the items available, and the ratio's akali gets, **full AP at that time** was just better.   


Fast forward to the new item rework... Everyone still goes full AP items. Akali really did get screwed with the new items though. (More so than other assassins, most of which like Zed, got major benefits in the form of new items like Duskblade rework). Akali's Q heal got removed due to the Gunblade healing, now that doesn't exist. Her early game pressure really came from the hextech gunblades burst as well, which is again, gone. (I'm not saying she was bad, she came out of the gate very strong with the item reworks. I'm just saying she did suffer comparatively).   


Now it's pick and choose. She really only had 1 viable path. Riftmaker + Conqueror. Conqueror was nerfed though, and so the healing isn't nearly as good. Akali needs sustain, or she's a glass cannon that's easily abused in elo's of even gold if she even tries to get aggressive.   


If you want the lane pressure, you can still go Night Harvestor, which is basically hextech's burst.   
\-------------------  


Apart from that, nothing too much changed, but it did hurt her. Sustain, or the burst to really help secure kills.   


\-------------------  


Lately I've been playing around with AD akali though, and wondering why people aren't abusing this...   


The build paths and utility for AP, are quite honestly suffering for Akali. It's a pretty straight run of the mill build, a full on burst AP mage. Maybe you might switch out Lichbane for Banshee's veil,, or Morellonomicon, but there are many things you can't really answer too properly, such as high tanky/high health characters. With the nerfs to Demonic Embrace + LIandry's, (and rightfully so), you're not really burning massive amounts of health anymore, and most tanks, and or bruisers will shrug off that damage anyway.   


With the addition of ""lets cram in health on tons of new AP items"" as well., many mages old school builds are now suddenly tankier in the health department as well. (I do actually love this change), but it does again, hurt akali, especially they build some MR into those larger HP pools.   


Of course none ofthis matters if you're hella fed, but we're not talking about that. Any champ can ignore everything when hella fed.   


\---------------------------  


**The argument for AD Akali.**   


To play AD Akali you do have to play slightly differently in how you engage, and fight, but her team fighting utility goes through the roof, and she can still chunk and burst very well, while having the utility to be tanky and sustainable in fights. Something the AP cannot do nearly as well.   


While she does lose something like 40% bonus damage on her last ult proc, in most cases in this meta, if you haven't killed the opponent by then anyway, chances are, you aren't going too. Or you're going to over extend reaching for the kill anyway. In most cases, the final proc of akali's kit is used to disengage, or re position anyway in a team fight, etc. (Yes I  know it's not always, but often times the way the ultimate works, you're going to be putting yourself in a bad spot anyway)   


The Q has more AD scaling than AP by a small %, and while the E, and passive have slightly more AP scaling, the utility of the items greatly overcomes that. (Especially if you're using Prowlers, which actually boosts your damage higher than AP)   


Through the AD items, you also get far more utility options to fight against your opponents, and deal with counter picks, or a tanky enemy team opposition. Instead of just relying on hourglass, and hopes and prayers.   


Mythics:   


Goredrinker: yes even with its nerf, it can be enough with Goredrinker + Deaths Dance can help you get in, assassinate, recover some health and get out. Pile that ontop of Ravenous Hydra for additional sustainability, unless you get caught in hard cc, you're getting out alive.. NO questions asked, and with a kill.   


Duskblade: Need I say more.. It plays off of your W, and lets you get away after a successful Assassination. No need to rely on anything else.. Get in, 1 shot, get out free of charge.   


Prowlers Claw: Yes, even this item that's almost never used, is amazing on Akali for an AD build.. It allows you to dash to help avoid skillshots, you can use it as the starter of your ultimate combo, making your skills, and ultimate do 15% more damage, and it can even be used as a free flash, by using it to get over walls thanks to a friendly enemy player in the right circumstances.   


Eclipse: You're a burst mage anyway as akali.. The passive after you Q, auto, Q will give you a shield, increase your speed to keep procing your passive easier, and bursts damage for 6%....   


None of the AP items have this level of utility. They are either help with sustain, or give flat burst. While the AD items, one gives burst in duskblade + survivability in getting away through stealth, one is straight burst heal, and the other has great mobility utility, and burst utility + I got caught in the jungle with no cd utility and can still use it to get away. etc. etc...  


Divine SUnderer: If you're going top akali, and up against a tank? Look no further.   


Regular Items:   


Deaths Dance + Guardian Angels gives you far better survivability than just Hourglass + Banshee's , and both give you great outright damage as well.   


Maw: Great against AP, gives you good damage, MR, and helps against burst in team fights, and the abundant amount of AOE's.   


Silvermere Dawn, who cares about CC anyway? While Banshee's can be easily popped, and you're caught out anyway, Silvermer Dawn isn't going to let you down like that. It works just like Mercurials, but without the wasted crit chance, and gives you health instead and 5 more MR.   


Still want a Banshee passive anyway ontop of Dawn because the enemy team has lots of CC? Hello Edge of Night for even more health.. 

Even high HP, high tank/regen champs aren't immune to akali with AD builds..   


Akali still gets access to Chempunk Chainsword to cut hp regen, and while you don't get HP% burns like AP, who cares? You're tankier, you have more health, and equal amount of burst, so you can stick on them for an extra second to finish them off anyway.  You could go Blade of the Ruined King to empower your passive procs for hp %, and help make your rotation faster, but really isn't worthwhile.   


Got a team with alot of shields? Yup, AD akali has an answer for that too, Serpent Fang helps you burst through those shields, and still do a great amount of chunk damage, that the AP akali would struggle with.   


AD akali hasn't even lost her ability to keep high mobility champs sitting, she can still use Serylda's grudge...   


\-----------------  


The AD build has everything and more the AP paths do, it allows you to have options for any opponent, and even top akali vs full tank can use too great effect items such as Divine Sunderer since it plays so heavily well with her passive proc, while having more survivability in terms of utility, mobility, and straight outplay potential over the AP akali.   


and if you feel like some of those AP items like hourglass, or banshee would still be useful? Awesome, you can still build those to full effect..   


So this is my argument.. Akali is actually better off as AD, and building AP into the kit given the circumstances, rather than going full AP and just dealing with lesser options.",leagueoflegends

Of course when these champions actually get buffed this has obviously turned out to be bad for the game and the novelty wears off after 1 game with udyr in it.

Many champions are kept slightly (or very) underpowered because they are really bad for game quality to see frequently. I know, I know, you can write anything to sound unfun, but some champions really are the most unfun of all to play vs when good.

A few more examples

Kog - Can't believe people have been constantly asking for kog buffs on reddit (posting his pick rates and being ""dead"" on stat sites etc).

Kog when buffed makes the entire game revolve around him especially in higher elo. The last time kog was meta in diamond+ at least, if kog was not banned the entire team would pick stuff like lulu+zilean and just win, seeing kog on the enemy team made everyone just want to instantly ff. Arguments like "":( he just outdated with dashes everywhere buff poor void puppy"" are so bad because all it takes it a very slight overtuning on his damage numbers and everyone who comes within auto range gets mowed down.

Corki - Pro presence aside which is the main reason his numbers are low, corki hitting you for 2k+ damage magic crits is just stupid.

t3_m4b9u8,How do you deal with the Toxic community of League?,"As the title suggests how do you overcome the horrific community that this game seems to accumulate?

Stopped playing last February as IRL got busy come back almost a year later but holy hell things have gone down hill fast and it was horrible before.

Maybe its just that way in Silver but funny enough normal draft almost seems worst to come across the most unpleasant rude childish people who you must hope it's an act and they don't exist outside of the game.

League is a great game itself it feels snappy interesting champs etc but its very much so a team based game and if someone on your team is just so toxic to be near you need to mute that is the team aspect in trouble.

I know other communities are bad such as World Of Warcraft but the fact this game is free seems to offer a level of protection as all you may have to loose is time so be the most horrific version of yourself and the consequences are little to none.

Do you just mute them hope for the best?
Do you only play 5 man pre-mades?
Do you give up and just accept it for what it is and stop playing?

What is the best solution ?",leagueoflegends

t3_m37gbl,Maybe More People Would Be Inclined To Jungle If Toxic People Actually Were Reprimanded,"EDIT 2: Gonna do this edit on the front since people apparently don't read until the end. Muting does not stop anyone from griefing. 

I've been queueing up JGL recently since queuing for any lane takes like 2min sometimes whereas qing jungle gets you into a game within 30 seconds. I was trying to learn the role (in normals draft) and I'm honestly just done. I'm not even tilted or mad, just exhausted.

I had a Draven mid laning vs Ahri. He was actually doing very well until they fought. Draven decides to follow after Ahri into the UNWARDED botside river Bush, gets charmed, eats R, Q, W and dies. What do I, with a 15 CS lead over the enemy jungler, 1/0/2 KDA, just coming back from base, had to read after that? ""You are so pathetic"" ""jgl gap"". He then proceeds to farm my jungle from then on out of spite. Can't match his clearing speed at all. I get behind in CS and items. He insults me even more. 

That Draven is still not banned. The fact that toxic idiots like that are allowed to freely play the game baffles me so much.

t3_m47x0q,Season 5 and 6 had the best Champion releases ever.,"For Season 5 we have Kalista, Bard, Reksai, Ekko, Tham Kench and Kindred.

For Season 6 we have Illaoi, Jhin, Asol, Kled, Taliyah and Ivern.

All of those champs are super unique and very distinctive in what they are suposed to do. All of them have a super interesting part on their kit that makes them unique. (Kalista with her hopping, Kindred with her ""wrong position"" as a marksmen hunting stack, Asol with his stars and so on).

They are like no others, todays champs feel like you have seen some abilities before like Samiras ult is kinda Katas Ult, Yone E is kinda lile Zeds Ult etc. Sure the newer champs also have something cool to them but, atleast for me, it doesnt get me as hyped up as in season 5 and 6.

I honestly wish for more interesting and ""wow we havent seen that before"" champs and before someone marks me as a complainer about new champs, no. I dont have any problems with the newer champs, they just dont feel as intuitive as older champs

Things to consider:

\- always going against Nasus, Galio, Rhys, Ezreal, and Alistar

\- bots won't show up until 2 mins

\- no way to predict what the first drake

\- Herald won't spawn until 8 mins, not an option

Present Comp:

\- Ziggs for the tower execute

\- Tristana for the DPS

\- Sion for his passive

\- Yi for Jungling and I-frames

\- Tryndamere for his ult and wave proxy

Present Strategy:

\- run down mid and execute on the tower before minions show up for some free damage

\- Tryndamere doesn't execute to proxy the wave

\- push indefinitely

\- At five minutes Yi does kills the drake for the buff

\- kill any bots that show up

As a jungler you have to make the decision of which lanes to help out, timing when to gank and when to farm. You also have to consider where the other jungler is always as you can take advantage of where and when he ganks by counter jungling or counter ganking. And above all else, jungle has the position 99% of the time to make game deciding plays and calls at objectives and team fights as jungle is the playmaking role. Succeed or at least be good at a multitude of by these factors, you should win 70-80% your games really easily. There are those outliers where you can’t win with troll players or players who don’t know how the game works and is boosted.

t3_m47vpx,5 and 4 man way tie are possible at the end of LEC Spring split 2020. Winners of tiebrakers according to rulebook.,"EDIT: OFC I'm taking about 2021 LEC Spring Split

So 5-way-tie is acutally possible, but it would take one huge upset which is MAD losing to Astralis. Other matches: 

SK beats AST

S04 beats VIT

MSF beats FNC

G2 beats MAD

MSF beats VIT

S04 beats XL

AST beats MAD

G2 beats SK

RGE beats FNC

If all of this happens we will have 5-man-tie for 3rd place. All of the teams will have 9-9 score. To win a tiebreker, games between involved teams are more important, and then if it's still tie, wins in 2nd half of split are taking to consideration. So placing would look like this:

3rd MSF 5-3 (6-3 in 2nd half)

4th SK 5-3 (5-4 in 2nd half)

5th MAD 4-4 

6th S04 3-5 (4-5 in 2nd half)

7th FNC 3-5 (3-6 in 2nd half)

4-way-tie is way more possible, all of the games need to be same as in 5-way-tie scenerio, only diffrence is that MAD needs to beat AST. Every team in 4-way-tie is having same head-to-head so we're taking into consideration only wins from 2nd half, then seeding would look like this:

4th MSF 3-3 (6-3 in 2nd half)

5th SK 3-3 (5-4 in 2nd half)

6th S04 3-3 (4-5 in 2nd half)

7th FNC 3-3 (3-6 in 2nd half)

So in both 5 and 4-way-ties Fnatic is not making it to play-offs and Misfits is jumping to top4.",leagueoflegends

t3_m47sbu,Game still starting when I dodged,"So last might I was playing some normals, but during champ select I decided I actually didnt want to play league anymore and dodged. Forward to today, I look at my match history and the game I thought I dodged, still started and ended in a remake, because I didnt play. Does this happen more often to other players as well, because it would explain the times someone spawned in and didnt buy items at the start and the game gets remade. If so, this really needs to be fixed, because it is very annoying for the ones still having to play the game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m2wn9r,"Buffing AD Katarina was cool, but let's tackle a REAL problem now: Nerfing AD Ziggs","Ziggs currently has a 0.8% pick rate and a 49% winrate. However, his AD Bruiser build has a 100% winrate when he goes Stridebreaker (Plat+; total 1 game). NO! This isn't how you're supposed play the game! 100% winrate on AD Ziggs is obviously unhealthy, since Ziggs is an AP champion and shouldn't be building AD.

  
I suggest nerfing the AD ratio on Zigg's Q.

OLD:  85 / 130 / 175 / 220 / 265 (+ 65% AP) magic damage

NEW:  85 / 130 / 175 / 220 / 265 (+ 65% AP) **(-50%AD)** magic damage

t3_m4k9et,"Believe it or not, we could be one step away from completing removing Autofill from the game","TL;DR: If its too long for you to read or if you don't have enough time most of the information you are looking can be found in the second paragraph.

Autofill has always been one of the most popular reasons to troll and ruin games. Although typing: *""mid or feed""* or *""I cant jg gg riot""* is toxic behavior, I don't blame anyone that says these things simply because they don't want to waste 30 minutes of their lives playing a champion or a lane they are not familiar with. No-one should be forced to play support if they don't want to. There is nothing more irritating than when you are all excited to play Vayne and do these fabulous montage-like plays only to be filled support/jungle. Not only that, but since dodging apparently is not an option your only option to avoid playing a role you don't enjoy is to pick some crazy off-meta picks *(irelia jungle, blitzcrank top, yasuo support)* and pray that this will be enough of a reason for your teammates to either dodge or swap lanes with you. In case the autofilled person decides to actually try playing support for the first time in Ranked, it'll end up an awful experience not only for them, but for their team too. Especially for their team, look at me as an example: I have about 15 games played as support this season and I only won 5 of them (33%) winrate when at the same time I have 50% winrate overall. Leaving the autofilled person with 3 options: 1. instalock a trollpick\*(and hope somebody swaps)*, 2. dodge*(and waste time &amp; LP)\* or 3. play the game and feel useless because you have no idea what you are doing and have everyone flaming you for underperforming which most likely will result in a loss leaving you with less LP regardless.

**So, why is autofill going to be removed soon?** Disclaimer, these are just my speculations so take them with a grain of salt but I do believe it's extremely likely that the autofill will be gone by season 11. Now that support has finally caught up in popularity with the other lanes Autofill protection for support is outdated and so is the autofill system as a whole. As you well know Riot added an option where now you can report people on champ select, this is done for many reasons obviously but what if one of those reasons where for Riot to see if people can cope with being autofilled or they deeply deprecate of it? On top of that and most importantly, Riot has stated a few times in the past their interest on updating Jungle, because of that it is safe to assume that the upcoming preseason will have Jungle as thematic, if that's the case and they manage to make jungle more enjoyable, hence increasing its popularity autofill will no longer be needed.

You may think: *""Okay, it might not be needed, but what if Riot decides to keep it anyways as a way to encourage players to try something different?""* We can't be certain, what we do know from an article [posted a few weaks ago](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/ask-riot-i-want-more-bans/)*(talking about adding more bans)* is that when Riot plans to make any system changes they evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of the change and if the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, the change they consider will be implemented.

Now, what are the benefits and drawbacks of removing autofill  after each role becomes somewhat equally popular?

Benefits:

* It'll decrease unsportsmanlike behavior and trolls in champ select.
* The playerbase will be more satisfied since they will play things they actually want to play.
* If everyone gets their role, game performance would be more consistent and healthier.
* \[I AM UNCERTAIN FOR THAT\] but it could also be a possible fix to ""elo hell"", one tricking a role (or two) can be deemed helpful.
* It'll decrease the amount of lobbies that are dodged, hence getting you into the game faster.

Drawbacks:

* Encouraging players to try a different role.
* Probably a few seconds shorter queue times.

As you can see, positive points clearly outweigh the negative points under the condition that every role is equally popular, but I really don't understand something. Yes even though queue times are shorter with autofill, more games end up being dodged so autofill doesn't actually get me into the game any quicker. Also, let's say that autofill gets people into the game quicker, I am sure a great percentage of you guys will volunteer to wait 2 more minutes and get what you want than play something you dislike for 30 minutes.

Thank you.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3p57q,How the Rework hurt Aurelion Sol and put him in the worst position.,"&amp;#x200B;

**How Aurelion Sol main's identify him**

If you go over to any main-champ subreddit, you see people complain about changes to their champ. That's common. But I yet have to see so many people who in a majority with many highly upvoted posts demand and agree with a champion change/revert such as the ASol mains. Recently a King Cobra asked on Twitter and the Asol subreddit how people identify Sol, either as a roaming champ with map pressure or a battlemage with consistent AoE damage in teamfights. With first glance you see that most people see him as a battlemage with mentioning that they specifically mean that they want his old W (the expanding stars) to be reverted. He mentioned that they wanted to do changes to his E (the flying ability) where he gets more options for higher numbers and generally he wanted to focus on Sol's roaming aspect. People, despite hearing the idea, mostly mentioned that they just want the old W back. Asol mains know that it will not fix Sol's core issues, he will still have his release problems, but at least he will have his original intended playstyle back. That is the main goal. The Asol mains just want the fun they fell in love with back not a buff. His core idea used to be a dancing dragon with roaming as a secondary.  [Source about Kobra here](https://twitter.com/RiotKingCobra/status/1365407376661049344?s=20) 

**The winrate argument**

But he has a high winrate over 50%, what is the issue? The winrate argument has two issues here. First and foremost, the main reason Sol wins his games is by being basically a second supporter with roaming pressure. The only reason he wins is because he causes his carries to be fed with his help. Which makes us wonder, why buff his only strength and ignore all of his flaws? Second and most importantly, only highly dedicated OTP's play him. We are talking about people who dedicate every game to only, really only play Sol. This champ has his own minigame inside of a match. Once you take a break, you have to relearn him. The less people play a champ, the less unskilled players use him, thus keeping the winrate high. His pick rate is according to [u.gg](https://u.gg/) **less than 1%** and there is only a handful of **10,778**  matches recorded this patch (11.5) in Plat+. For reference, the most played Champion Kai'Sa has a pick rate of **34.9%** and **434,061** recorded games, Banrate of  **32.1%**  and yet has a lower winrate than Sol (rougly 1% lower). Imagine how high it would be if only OTP's and the good Kai'Sas would play that Champion. It would be at least 60% maybe even 70%. Besides, on Sol's peak days his pickrate was only at 5-6%, years ago. The winrate does not change that the mini-rework destroyed a lot of Sol's laning phase including the reduction of his passive damage. The Old Sol was able to compensate a losing lane better with just keeping his W up. It was not flawless, but it was an option. The YouTuber Exil actually made a good video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Akp1SKbS8Jk&amp;ab_channel=Exil) explaining similiar problems and the YouTube Vars has a good video explaining other issues [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykt5ohGaz38&amp;ab_channel=Vars) but they missed out on the biggest issue which is the following:

**The idenitity crisis of Aurelion Sol**

Originally, this champion was supposed to be basically a consistent dps mage (battlemage?). After the rework he was turned into a burst mage. The issue starts with the whole kit still being designed to set up your W. Why is this bad? Because his Q does minimal damage and is meant to be a stun only, his E is just him flying and his ultimate does less damage than a Xerath Q and is only a disengage (can be still be overwritten by dashes). Problem is, burst mages i.e. Annie, Veigar always have *at least 2 high damage abilities and 1 very damaging ultimate.* Sol only has his W for high damage. The next issue starts here. So to compensate, the W is super fast and has low cooldown where in the very end, the game fundamentally just tells us ''Use your W as much as possible, make it like it is permanent'' while at the same it says ''whoa there, your damage is too consistent, better stop now, buddy''. Which causes an issue you might have guessed, inconsistency. What do you wanna do when suddenly the newest hypermobile champions just dodge your W, wait it out and burst you in the 1-3 seconds of cooldown you have there? Either basic attacks, run away or nothing. Even a rylais combined with phase rush, cosmic drive and swiftness boots will not fix that core issue. Aurelion Sol is a burst mage while still acting like dps mage, which makes him just lacking in both in the end. The playstyle philsophy of his original kit was that of a dancing dragon (the alternative name for Chinese/Celestial Dragons). That was the true fun of his kit, was he still weak in lane? Yes. Were there still better options mid? Yes. But it is this very reason, that dancing playstyle, that people fell in love with him. As the King Cobra himself somehow admitted what Asol was supposed to be with his question, he is a **consistent AoE battlemage** and will always try to act like it, no matter the number tweaking or E changes, the Champion himself will tend to behave like his original kit but worse. The new kit even struggles with Item synergy (you will be very stressed in what to build). We have had more than one year to see if he is fun, which based on the conclusion I got from the Asol-mains, he lost a great portion of it. Is the champ useless? No. Does he lack damage? No. Was he more fun before? Yes. If Rengar can get his Q reverted, Zac his ultimate and Kog'Maw his W , then Aurelion Sol can have his own W back. 

**The purpose of a rework**

Whenever you look at previous mini-reworks such as Rengar, Kog'maw, Zac and most infamously LeBlanc. You see that their pressence increased more than before or at least stayed consistent. The champions did not ''vanish'' in a sense. To make things short: A rework's purpose is to make a champion more relavent/present in the currently changed game or even the game's pacing. It is the most common problem that a rework causes previous mains to be alienated from the champion and yet somehow people still played them frequent enough. The reason why Riot reverted those champions is very simple honestly, they noticed that they hurt the original playstyle that the champions were created for. Zac used to bounce around a lot, Rengar used to burst you quickly and could triple-Q, LeBlanc used to jump in quickly and get out and Kog'Maw used to kite and shoot'n'run during battles. It is with those champions that Riot Games waited maximum one season to see if they kept the original **fun** of the champion and then reverted them after they saw that they did a mistake. Not only was Asol's last patch longer than a year ago, it was also a nerf while Riot Games did not even bother to change his stats because of the new items (he suffered a lot with removal of GLP and RoA). What happened to Aurelion Sol? Did he get more popular or could he keep up with the game's changes? The answer is no, it is even the oppossite. Barely anyone was interested in the rework, the Sol mains got upset. Many Sol mains quit the champion and many even quit the game. At least the alienated reworked Aatrox still has a pressence to the game to this day (**78,953 matches)**. So it is quite easy to conclude that the rework failed and only hurt those who were already highly dedicated to the champion.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3zufw,When someone is really toxic ingame i worry about their mental health and invite them to vc after the game.,"You know the drill, somebody runs it down on accident.

The affected player gets upset and toxic.

The downward spiral begins, turns a winnable game into acid. Like 2 players going off on each other. Up to the point of:

Runs it cuz the other person doesnt ""deserve"" the win

Being super homophobic and racist in chat like 3 letter magic words toxic.

These kind of people. Who just lost it. Mental go boom.

I worry about them alot. They are addicted to the game. They dont want to play it because they enjoy the game itself. They **need** to play because they **need** to win. They cant control it. And if somebody hinders them from winning they get super toxic.

Ive had it so many times, that when i talk to them, they either just break down completely or become reasonable after the first 5 minutes of talking. Some tho are just mental cases. Like i try to explain to them that playing in that mental state makes it highly unlikely to win a game. ""Lol ur just trash"" blablabla stuff like that some people cant be reasoned with.

If somebody is having a rough game and u can tell just talk to them. Some may show some gratitude. Some become a friend, some will call u worthless ""slur"", some change for the better, some just need someone to talk to.

It would make the game so much more comfortable if people would stop behaving like absolute degenerates and understand that there is another person behind that screen. Someone just like u.

By talking we humanize its no longer 

xyz(champ):

its a person that needs help like everybody else, having someone to talk to helps. they can vent, they can just talk about it, they can be reasoned with.

Sometimes i feel like its a lost battle with some people who just want to die on their hill, but sometimes it can help and people see reason.

If u ever get into a game with someone who is having a mental breakdown talk to them, snap them out of it, thats how the league community can improve.",leagueoflegends

Instead of 3 mythics giving 3% move speed for every item you build. Why can't they give 10% slow resist or something because there's literally no other item that gives slow resistance other than boots.

Ever since I've started playing this game, it's been my wish to some day unlock mastery level 7 on all champions. At the beginning, it seemed like an impossible task. But finally, after so many years, I've managed to do it. According to [masterypoints.com](https://masterypoints.com) , I'm currently one of the 33 players in the world who has achieved this feat. :D

From Blitzcrank back in 2016 to finally Rakan in 2021! And I hope to carry on unlocking lvl7 on the newly released champions in the future as well.

Edit:  

A lot of you have been asking for tips on getting S or S+ . So I came up with the idea of starting a Youtube channel and share the gameplays of how I get S or S+ on certain champions. If you guys are interested, you can follow my channel. Don't expect anything special though, since I'm terrible at video editing and other shiizz. But I can show you the science behind the algorithm Riot has put for giving mastery score.

The link is given below: (will post contents if it gets enough response/subs)

t3_m48k0m,victorious skin question,"hey guys just a simple question about the victorious skin. If I reach (for example) diamond but at the end of the season I end plat, do I get the diamond chroma anyway? I mean, at the end of the season do they consider the actual rank you are at the end or your peak rank? thx",leagueoflegends
t3_m31eyi,Why on earth does Tristana's ultimate target minions?,"I have never, ever seen this used to the benefit of a tristana player. It's terrible wave clear, has a very small aoe radius, and 99.999% of the time if a tristana player targets a minion with it they meant to actually click a champion. 

The only possible situation I could understand this being a skill based mechanic rather than an oversight is if a champion just happens to be standing on the very edge of a yasuo windwall or samira w. If there are no other champions nearby to ult, a tristana could possibly ult a minion nearby and the aoe may reach the intended target. I highly doubt this exact situation has happened enough times to warrant the mechanic.

If there were reasonable situations in which this mechanic was helpful, I would understand the argument of ""just get better at the game and stop clicking minions"". That isn't the case though. It seems so much more like an oversight that causes confusion for players of all skill levels, rather than an interesting mechanic that allows for skill expression.

Is there something I'm missing here? I've probably played 200+ games on tristana, and I haven't found any situations where this mechanic is helpful. I'm curious to hear if you guys have found times where this is useful though.

EDIT: vast majority of people are just telling me to get good, and that’s fine. I do at least think there should be some more visual clarity though. Most of the time Tristana uses an ult on a minion, the minion instantly dies. This means that, especially because I’m not looking at the minion, it can be super difficult to see who even got hit by the ultimate. It just looks like the ultimate disappeared especially in the heat of the moment. I can only imagine it is even more confusing for newer tristana players or people with plain bad eyesight. If I mistakenly use my ultimate, it should be extremely clear to me as soon as I use it.

Nobody uses malzahar ultimate and says “did... did I use it yet?”. Same thing with soraka or Olaf or literally any other champion in the game. Even fucking teemo shrooms have a very clear projectile to see and identify immediately. Keep in mind, this is a champion’s *ultimate* we are talking about here. Tristana’s ultimate is just a bigger, slightly more orange autoattack. I’m not saying we need to change the projectile. I don’t know anything about game design. I have no clue if that would solve the problem. I’m just saying we should either:

1) remove this entirely from the game because it’s almost never useful and causes more harm than good.

2) make it more clear to players when they fucked up and misclicked.",leagueoflegends

I even want to see who is this ""lonely prince"". Maybe it is someone we know ? But it is still a mystery. I would love to see that lonely prince get released at one point , and maybe it is actually Viego , when he was a prince. Maybe when Viego met Isolde , he dropped his plaything , Shaco. So maybe the mage who made Shaco for Viego got mad , and enchanted the Shaco to be like this. They do say ""loss of his beloved charge"" , so this does means that the prince died at one point. So it might not be Viego. Maybe lonely prince was the Blessed Isles prince at one point , but died by unknown reasons , then Shaco got enchanted and became a Demon Jester. I'm just making some assumptions and theories because Shaco's lore is very interesting yet unexplained. I hope we can see the lonely prince and Shaco's lore in the future.",leagueoflegends

But I miss TT. Howling Abyss is still 5v5, and I can't pick who I want to play. Summoner's is too full of folks who want to take it much more seriously than I have time for.   


TT, with it's 3v3 playstyle, allowed the casual player the ability to have fun and be decent at the game. It was fun.   


The game is really missing a mid range level between ARAM and Summoner's. Perhaps it's outgrown folks like me, who started playing in 2012. Folks who play Ziggs and Amumu and Lisandra because they like them, even if they aren't popular right now.

Shield has two teams, Team Sword and Team Spear; we are looking to have both teams join FFS. For this to happen, we are looking to add two sub junglers, one sub-top laner, and one sub mid laner. Starting and sub positions never set and stone, meaning players can earn or lose their starting position. Here are the base requirements; these are negotiable:

&amp;#x200B;

a. Ranked between Silver IV and Platinum II

b. Eight games of Ranked Solo/Duo weekly

c. Four games of Ranked Flex with team weekly (Between 4 pm -8 pm EST)

d. Playing in the weekly scrims (2-6 matches, Between 4 pm - 8 pm EST)

t3_m35uw7,Playing Tryndamere is fueling my gambling addiction.,"Yeah, so hell yeah I'm in lane, just farming at level 3, the other guy is playing Jax. 

I walk up to him with a full rage bar and auto attack. He uses counterstrike and dodges it. As I walk back, he follows, and stuns me.

The stun wears out, I spin onto him. We start auto attacking eachother.

He auto's and W's me.

I auto, and I crit.

He auto's me again.

And so do I, and I crit.

He auto's me one last time and Q's into the caster creeps.

But I too auto him as he is jumping away, and I crit.

At this point, he is sitting on 60 HP. I follow him with my Spin again, and he flashes away. I flash on him under tower as he pops his last corrupting pot, giving him 75 HP.

A magnificent bait, if I do say so myself, but I do manage to auto him one last time, and I crit.

I kill him, and survive the tower shot with a sliver of health after using my bloodlust heal.

As I recall, my botlane gets double killed by a Kai'sa/Thresh and my jungler lost both scuttles to a Karthus somehow, but I do not care, for I am in this prepetual climax state from then until the end of the game. 

I simply bring up the chat and type ""/all Top Gap"".

We end up losing that game, infact, I end the game 4/4 after some failed splitpushing attempts, but it is ok, because in my heart, I had already won the moment I critted 4 times in a row.

What was the point? Almost every item gives AH just like last season with CDR, it makes no difference. There is no ""high AH builds vs low ones"", it's all just the same as before.

Am I wrong, or was the Ability Haste rework was a waste of time and didn't change anything except make the stat more obtuse.",leagueoflegends

- likewise no ""perfect"" keystone, conq/grasp are fine but neither really enable her

- more item dependent than average bruiser; many of her items are nerfed due to other bruisers being op with them.

- duskblade synergy was wrongly removed by riot in a targeted act of persecution

t3_m45dnr,I'm hardstuck in Bronze and no longer know what to do,"Hey

TL;DR: My and my friend wins our lane almost every time, but really bad junglers constantly ruin our winrate 

It's kind of a letdown to actually post this in here, cause I've been fighting and trying to keep my calm whilst playing in hopes of beginning to climb the rank ladder - but without hope. Normally I'm playing ADC with my friend who mains support. I'm maining Vayne and Kai'sa. My CS and mechanics are all great. We consequently win our lane almost every single time, but hyper carrying has been almost impossible with some of the players that we're playing with. Junglers mostly ruin our game by either hard-inting our lanes or simply just not doing anything. I've paid grandmasters and former challengers to look through my gameplay and providing me constructive feedback, and I've heard that I could easily be plat if practising some more, and I've been practising a lot on my issues (as everyone has).

I've tried my best and I keep fighting to climb that ladder, but it's been absolutely impossible with the teammates my bud and I have had. Every time I hit Bronze 1, I get together with a team that's either intentionally inting or is just really bad at the game and I demote again. I know that I'm not the only one with these problems, and that's why I'm making this post. 

Should I main another role? Does anyone have tricks they used when they finally climbed that ladder?

I'm certain that it's gonna be easier to climb when I hit silver. I'm at EUW right now.

How, in such a competitive game, is there autofill and why don't Riot change it?

With E-Sports on the rise in popularity both in-game and viewership, I am shocked to be auto filled so often. Imagine if in a professional game of soccer being 'auto filled' from a goalkeeper to striker, two VERY different roles. Yes, you'd still be playing soccer on the same pitch, but it's so drastically different.

I have mained jungle since season 7 and have transitioned into top halfway season 10. Since the middle of season 10 jungle has changed so much that I doubt I would know where to start, not to mention all the items changes and champ adjusts, I wouldn't know the strength and power spikes on my previous mains.

Can someone explain to me why we still have to put two roles and not just one ESPECIALLY in ranked?

Like on 1:39 they said they will be adding a enchanter item to counter dive or anti carry teams; I really thought redemption was almost this new item?????????? but I guess it will be on steroids. Maybe now supports vs a heavy heavy dive team filled with assassin will go both??? and if you are a crazy support even go locket almost counter a entire lethality item or flatmagic pen(can we have  a proper name for this like lethality pls??) so to truly make a living hell to te opponent.

On 1:39; a new tank item aimed to counter split pushing, isn't this warmog's????????????? I guess people didn't but it enough and now we need a new shinny overpowered version right? Holy! when was the last time that split pushing was a win con in a game????? Maybe on  last night on  Iron promos to bronze! Dear lord split pushing has been dead for years, it is simple how the game has evolved and I don't think even buffing split pushing would make it better! I would be so sad to be a yorick main at this point, the whole kit is about split pushing and I guess now split pushing is even worst and even more niche.

 The game is only team fight now! The team that has the better team comp to team fight will always win cuz objectives like baron, drakes and elder drake are so broken. Taking towers doesn't give the person(or the team like in the past) enough gold not even the"" space advantage"" mean anything to be worth taking. Only turret plates are good enough to justify taking towers.

Also I don't think these itens fill a gap we need now. There a lot of  item gaps in the game that we need to be filled first before these. We also need more intens like serpent's fang or navori quickblade. Niche itens like these are awesome.

It just seems riot wants to dumbfy and simplify the game. So everyone that is too lazy too think and make good decision can play.

About hardbound and looking at stats to balance your game; How can you do this?

Problem: the player. We have lived in a meta where one single build, on single core item was the best on the champion(think like ezreal and tear for almost 10 years, only now he kinda disattached from that item only to be brought back a few patches later). I get games on GM where a vayne is fed on the early game vs kha jg and talon mid she still goes kraken and zerks because they have a sion top I guess doing 400 true damage and 200 crit isn't enough right? grated this a generalization but even then it is almost challenger where decision making should be more valued no? and it isn't like other mythic are bad, all of them seems pretty balanced. Maybe even op considering other classes are taking it.

Give players more time. You as a design should also be patient. Was really  bold to think you could make a overhaul in one year of the items. even if it was based on the old.

Btw ability haste was such a fucking failure. Almost nobody over caps cdr, if they do they butcher they build in unholy ways. And let's talk about why do I have to sell my house my dog my cat and my car just to get 40%????? it used to be able to achieve it with two itens now I need 3 or four. Only lucidity boots are saving these kinds of builds.

On 2:38 ""Enchanters and mages, we think need some more work on their mythic item""

First enchanters: Imperial is a terrible item was only good when it was overtuned. Dam right they need more mythic itens. Moonstone seems almost too unhealthy for the game, it is simple a on steroids Athene's. Making the heal overtime would be a good direction for the item to be more balanced. And for some  reason yet nobody is abusing 3 to 2 moostone comps, go fig.

On the mages end: they need work man a lot. And not only the mythics the legendary as well. The build paths sucks, can't fuckign believe for a lot of itens people need to wait more than 800 and mythics more than 1k to finish their items. I really starting to think dark seal and mejai's are a bandaid solution to bridge evey item of mages, cuz they are so expensive. On pbe there a good direction for rabadon, and a nice slight nerf to void second. Very good granted. But bloody hell why you making liandrys so fucking niche?????? and broadening so much ludens'?????? I guess mages not only build 99% ludens and everfrost of their games.

3:33 "" without sustain, some of lane trades can end up being so punishing..."" this has too much to talk about I cba. Sustain is only good people that can spell lane, unless is overtuned like he said. I'm glad you guys are nerfing sustain in lane, it really sucks to play vs a fucking irelia that has no idea how to wave manage and to trade to simply go win get 50% hp worth of damage and heal back to full. But this won't be removed soon sadly. Btw really fucking glad you guys GW was't super trash, it was just that healing is through the roof.

4:33 ""... marksmen and enchanters were in too weak of a spot"" ??? what??? enchanters were fine from the beginning, even overtuned considering their items now are nerfed in comparison to the start no ??? Marksmen were also fine and now are op. Why did you buff them? just because most adcs can't build? or because all brozens and irons cried so much? They itens are insanely cost efficient and have the best build paths in the game.

If you wanna look at stats fine. But start asking the right questions, pondering the right problems. And being patient. You guys are team and should look and have a grip on the game holistically.

5:19 really would like if you guys focused on comeback mechanics. The game is way way too much decided by the team that gets ahead, and if the losing team ends up winning they have to have insane luck to the enemy team royaly fuck up or have to lift the entire world to win. Maybe also adress the itens too

Again; ask the right questions, ponder the right problem. don't be hasty be patient.

t3_m3sup4,Reworking and adding AP bruiser items,"Currently, we have only very few AP bruiser items (items that support DPS playstyles). The defensive options with AP (Zhonya, Banshee) are geared towards squishies as stasis or a one-spell spellshield do not help when you stand in the middle of 3-5 opponents, have to tank and be a nuisance. And two of the four items (Rylais, DE) are shared with mages(makes them dependant on mage balancing, mages value AP over very defensive options) and DE was even gutted from an AP bruiser perspective (less defensive steroid, less DPS than its first version on PBE, it had 2% burn and 20+5 per champ resistances) while for mages it only got minor nerfs(-10AP, burn)

AP bruiser items are always under threat to be picked by mages(who mostly should be squishy) and be abused for good AP values while providing defensive stats.

The easiest and most efficient solution would be to shift power from raw AP into passives that empower DPS, but mostly durability to separate them from items for DPS mages (like Liandries which has no defensive stats but burn for DPS). Low AP values on the items would deter mages from buying them as this anti-synergizes with Deathcap, THE mage capstone.

For example(not mentioned stats remain same as live):

* Riftmaker: 40 AP, 350 HP, Damage Amp 18% over 6 seconds, Mythic passive no longer grants AP but instead 1.5% extra max Damage Amp (up to 24%)
* Demonic Embrace: 30AP, 10AH, 450 HP, 2%burn, Armor/MR removed
* New TF item: 35AP, 150HP, passive: Gain 60/120/180/260/350 max HP and 8/13/18/24/30 Armor/MR depending on the number of enemy champs near you(removed after 3s out of combat, never decreases in combat)
* New Grievous Wounds item: 30AP, 15 AH, 350 HP, passive: 40% base Grievous, 60% Grievous to champs that are more than 4 seconds in combat with you
* New %Pen item: 30AP, 10AH, 300HP, passive: Gain 15(+5 per second in combat)% MPen, capping at 35%

Having low AP items with powerful passives would certainly cater towards AP bruiser build diversity (add more items on top, like AP+Armor or AP+MR) and sharpen their identity as durable DPS. Mages would never buy their items since they all have low AP (just like most ADC don't buy AD bruiser items as they want DPS over HP).

Im sure there would be people that would create insane modes and Riot legit profits without doing anything except to hand the tools (not like they could make some official modes to show off what you can make in this creative mode).

Some ideas:

1. Map Selection
2.  Team size (X vs. Y)
3. Champ Selection (all random, all same, defined, whitelisted/blacklisted champs, multiple champs, voted champs, nemesis)
4.  Custom Stats (AP,AD, HP, AH, ...)
5. Spell Scalings (if champs defined)
6. Levels (Xp Gain on kill, cs, time)
7. Gold Gain (start gold, gold per second, gold for kill/assist/death/walking/spellhit/levelup, ...)
8. Starting Items, Item White/Blacklist, Item Stats (AD, AP, Price ..)
9. Buffs and Debuffs with custom properties (Type (Slow, Stun, Disarm, Nearsight, Dot, ...), Duration , Application)
10. Entities with custom properties (model (minions, jungle monsters, dragon, herald, baron), walking, standing, following a path, attacking, size,  stats, gold drop, xp, ... )
11.  Trigger Events (game time,  spellhit/damage/kill/assist/death, item purchase, champ x dies, objetive kill , multi kill ...)
12. win conditions (cs, team kills, objective, kill entity/champ, deal x damage, heal x damage, buy certain items, timer do x in 10 mins)

I know that some things may be not implementable because engine restrictions (6v6) but i think you could still make most of it.

I just cant see where this would bring negative impact to the game. You have so many players if they play your game, they play your game no matter if its Summoners Rift or a custom gamemode. I mean other games manage to do this aswell so i dont think its a resource problem too.

t3_m49gtw,Autofill just should not be in place in ranked,"Pretty much every single person I have talked to would be willing to wait 10 actual minutes to get into a game and have everyone actually playing roles they know how to play. What is the point in having autofill in place to make the queue quicker when it just leads to 20+ minutes of wasted time in a game that is doomed from the very beginning. Players get autofilled into support or something and have a massive ego and instead of dodging and losing 4 LP they would rather coinflip and lock in bard and perma roam hoping their team can 4v5 with them being enough of a non factor to bring home a win. It doesn't make the experience any better, it shortens the queue time so you quickly get into a game that is destined to lose. Riot has said by their own measurement and [u.gg](https://u.gg)'s measurements that all 5 of the roles have a pretty even distribution of mains, so I really don't believe that it is making the queues meaningfully faster either. All autofill does is make the quality of games drastically lower whenever there is autofilled players. And yes I get that I could be the one to dodge, and I absolutely do dodge games, but it gets annoying when you have to do it several times a day.

t3_m3s13c,A discussion regarding the last Azir nerf,"Hi there, just an angry Azir main trying to get some attention to the problem. Azir got his solider’s (W), attack damage reduced by 10 (60-160&gt;&gt;&gt;50-150) which might not seem like a lot but to me it seems that it totally killed him off early game. I haven’t really mastered him yet, (only 250K points) but to me it seems like it killed him off as a champion, and I feel like I’m not the only one (just look at [r/Azirmains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Azirmains/)). I still like to play him tho, and sometimes even manage to win, but it feels like if there’s just a semi-decent Yasuo or Zed against you, (and don’t make me start about Yone) you lose hard, since you just cannot muster up enough damage especially in the first 15 minutes, compared to the previous patch. I know Azir is meant to be hard, since his kit has so much potential, but this has made him basically unplayable (43 % winrate).

Do you think that there is a way to balance him, or will Riot do nothing about him like in the past?",leagueoflegends

t3_m441pv,The state of Zilean,"OTP Zilean here who still struggles to find the way of playing him since new season. Would like to hear your opinion. 

Back in days I was comfortably Platinum OTP Zilean, now days I struggle to play him in low Gold.  There are few reasons for it: 

1) few more added super mobile champions who can dash into Zilean and negate all of his advantages. 

2) New itemization made him too dangerous to play mainly as a damage dealer (Zilean has a great AP scale so normally you would try to stack AP). Currently I am trying to play as tanky facilitator but that means I never get as much damage as back in my Platinum days. 

and 3) Which is the most annoying for me is the new item Galeforce. Basically any non-dasher champs having this Item completely renders ZIlean useless. Back in days I felt comfortable fighting Darius, Tryndamere, Nausus and big number of other non-dashers in 1v1. But Galeforce is a game changer in a bad way for Zilean players - You can't micro any more in 1v1.

Zilean needs some sort of update, either his Q should have a better range or bombs should fly quicker. As bonus, Zilean's passive and auto attack should be reviewed too.

t3_m3t44l,Question about deaths in a game,"So, I was playing with a ADC who started writing “f***ing intint repor u etc etc” after the game. Me and another player hade a few more deaths then the rest, maybe 2-3. So it wasn’t an insane amount more. And I’m fairly new, like 4-5 weeks in LoL and lvl 40. 

What I wanted to get your opinion is this:

- I act as a block to shield my ADC (I play nautilus). I try to intercept or peel to get the enemy off them. Many times I do die since my ADC is super low, and I rather take the death since they can carry the game, I can’t. Is that wrong? Should I just let them die? This normally happens in mid game and in middle lane. 

- I tried to push a lane myself since the enemies where engaged on the other side of the map, and the tower was almost down (the one before their base). I got a lot of ???? on me due to that. What I read online and seen in videos is that you should do just that, since you don’t get noticed. This time around, I did die from their jungler. But normally, isn’t that the best option?

t3_m439jh,What compels people to be disgusting?,"NOTE: I've reported the player, but I just wanted to get a perspective of what compels some people to being just shitty human beings.  


Just playing aram with 2 friends, and just had my first experience in 2021 of racism... in ARAM of all things. Why? Because I'm indian, and my summoner name has the word ""brown"" in it. I've gone through a crappy childhood with 9/11 and all the typical anti-brown mumbo jumbo. I've formed a pretty thick skin   
because of it. I have it in my summoner name because its a way for me to harden my skin, and not get bothered by stuff like this.  
 

But tonight I was just playing some ARAM with the boys after a rough day... and I see in all chat ""being brown is a sin"" from an enemy player. And then it was a nonstop barrage of it. ""I can smell the brown"", ""being brown means you have single digit iq"", and a bunch more I just feel too sickened to type. Ya I said some vile things back (I didn't go racist), but I was heated. I've mentioned that in my report, and if I get punished for what I said, sure I probably deserve it. But I hope the other person gets punished hard. I see no logical reason for someone to be racist in any game, more or less in match of ARAM of all things.  
 

So maybe I'm missing something. Maybe there's a perspective I'm not seeing or understanding. Is there some possible logical explanation for acting like that? Cuz I don't get it. It's 2021, I thought people would be past this kind of behavior by now.

t3_m3hei6,What's your best settings option to kite as an ADC? and how you avoid miss clicks?,"Hi ..

So i have been exploring new ways and player mouvments settings to find the best way to kite, especially as an ADC, of course there is no perfect easy way to kite, otherwise half of the game mechanic skills are gone, but i'm trying to find the best one.  
Mainly, there are 2 popular player mouvement options most ADC players use.   
\-1: ""Player attack move"" 

[\\""Player attack move\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/7nxjh4vdilm61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b0fea2612f96815f09a59b4788e4637528007bc)

this option allow you to show your max AA range (this can be disabled in the settings), and the cursor turns into a circle that you can put on a champion/minion to attack, but the most bad thing about this is that you have to click again with your left mouse in order to attack, which feels kinda slow and will cause you to cancel a lot of your AA especially early game when your attack speed is low.   
i wish if there was an option on auto-attacks like the one on the spells where you can use ""Replace Quick cast with Quick cast with indicator in the quickbind UI"", meaning you can just hold ""A"" key (""player attack move"" keybind), put the attack little circle on a target, and when you let go of the ""A"" key again, your champion attacks, instead of having to left click with your mouse again.  
\-2: ""Player attack move click""  


[\\""Player attack move click\\""](https://preview.redd.it/vkyypcmuilm61.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=525056d2645935d262a51f4bd66f75e948f9be09)

This option allow you to make your champion attack either the closest target to your champion, or the closest target to your cursor (you can change that in the options), what's good about this option is that you only have to press your key once (for me i use it on the A key) with ""attack closest target to cursor"" option on, and this is currently the one i'm using, but the bad thing about this, probably the worst thing that can happen to you is attacking a minion when the enemy champion is in the middle of his own minions, so if you want to hit the enemy champion you have to either put your cursor very close to him and he MUST be inside your AA range otherwise you'll attack the closest minion inside your AA range again, or you'll have to put your cursor on the champion in order to attack him, which you might miss click few times during the game (for me it happens a lot).  
btw, even if you toggle ""Attack champions only"", you'll still attack minions if you press the key of ""Player attack move click"", otherwise as i said before, half the skills are gone.  
So with that being said, does anyone have some tips or recommandations i can try please?.   
i want to develop the best kitting skill possible, that have both speed and less- maybe 0 miss clicks possible chances (even when the enemy champion is between his own minions).  
any advice would be really appreciated :) ty",leagueoflegends

t3_m2mk83,We Can Pick You a Champion That Fits In the Composition With Decision Tree OVA &amp; Matrix Factorization Models,"**TL;DR:** [Lola.gg](https://Lola.gg) now has a pre-game feature that generates **champion pick** suggestions based on both teams' compositions, lane counters, ADC/Support partners, latest patch's meta, your champion masteries and play-style. Picks are generated **using advanced machine learning models** and are separated into 3 categories: Lola's picks, comfort picks, and new picks. All done automatically **in real-time** while you are in champ select. How it looks: [Champ Select - GIF - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/9GFyd6q) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lola** **Desktop App is in Free Open Beta!**

Lola is a Riot-reviewed 3rd party app (App ID 486007 &amp; 465359) that is downloadable from Microsoft Store for free. We recently added a pre-game feature to the app, and that is a **real-time contextual pick assistant**. Lola can generate personalised champion picks based on the below factors:

1. Your **team composition** so far

2. Opponent team composition so far

3. **Lane counter**

4. ADC/Support **partner synergy**

5. Latest patch's **meta**

6. Your **personal champion pool** (masteries, time played)

7. Champion **play-style** similarity

&amp;#x200B;

# How the real-time pick suggestion will look like in-app: [Champ Select - GIF - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/9GFyd6q) 

Best of all, this happens in real-time automatically while you are in champ select. **No messy Ctrl+C Ctrl+V required!** Lola will even categorize enemy team's picks into their respective lanes based on probability. Once it is your turn to pick, Lola will generate several picks separated into 3 main categories below. This happens instantaneously. If you hover your mouse over them, each pick will have detailed explanation/scores of Lola's reasonings. This is relative to your own champion pool, including the free champion rotation.

1. **Lola's picks**: 'overall' picks that take into account of everything, a holistic view if you may

2. **Comfort picks**: emphasise on your personal champion pool, but other factors will still account for the consideration

3. **New picks**: discover new champions to learn (but try this in normals not ranked!)

You can then lock in one of these picks in-app **without even going back to your game client!** Simply click on one and click the 'Lock Champion' button. ([Lock-in - GIF - Imgur](https://imgur.com/aMJuB4r))

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't just look at win rates! Consider the lot.**

How does Lola decide all these factors? Lola's brain consists of, not one, but **several machine learning models** trained with Diamond rank and above's match data sourced over 11 regions using Riot's API. The methods used to train these models are matrix factorization and OVA based on a decision tree binary classification algorithm.

Completely optional, but if you are interested in the basic technical details:

1. **Matrix Factorization**: the input data form a matrix, which will then be decomposed or reduced into its constituent parts. Coordinate descent method is used in Lola's case to find the low-rank factor matrices, in another word, the most probable recommendation. *Netflix* and *Amazon* uses something similar for their movie/product recommendation for users.

2. **Decision tree-based OVA**: OVA or One-Versus-All *(not to be confused with the quirk in the anime My Hero Academia)* uses a binary classification algorithm, an implementation of the MART gradient boosting algorithm in Lola's case, to train an unique classifier for each class. You can think of champions as 'classes' so there will be a lot of these binary classifiers. Prediction is performed by running the relevant classifiers to get the prediction with the highest score.

&amp;#x200B;

# What else can Lola do?

Other than contextual pick suggestions above, Lola also provides ban suggestions based on current meta ([Ban phase - GIF - Imgur](https://imgur.com/pKAK8Gj)) and also act as an in-game cooldown timer (see our [old reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/jgxlq1/want_to_track_enemy_spell_ulti_cooldowns_in_style/) for the in-game feature)

However the current LCS format with 3 matchdays per week could be implemented in the LEC as well which would give the players more official matches through which they can improve and give the viewers more games to watch.

I just wish we had some clarity on when we might see the changes.

&amp;#x200B;

A super valuable last pick Sylas for JimieN to counter the first pick Seraphine ensures that Machi secures the victory against Berjaya Dragon. 

&amp;#x200B;

LYB 0-1 HKA

&amp;#x200B;

A debut victory for Kongyue. HKA looked a lot better post 15 minutes but still has room for improvement as some of the decisions made by HKA looked suspectible. Nevertheless, HKA looked like a much improved team with Kongyue and should look to lock in their spot in the playoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

PSG 1-0 BYG

&amp;#x200B;

PSG got their revenge by winning against BYG in the Match of the Week. Although BYG has a better early game than PSG with Liang solokilling Hanabi and Doggo getting a double kill after a gank from Husha, PSG managed to secure all the objectives. The big first teamfight happened in the 16th minute with BYG getting the mountain drag and Doggo getting another kill and consequently the rift herald.However, Byg's inability to control the dragons led to PSG getting the mountain soul and the resulting teamfight ended up in an ace for PSG with only Unified dying on PSG's side. The next teamfight was won by BYG's mid whose Orianna ulted 3 people and BYG racked up 3 kills and got the baron. Kaiwing got a nice flank off in the next teamfight and managed to ult the fed carry of BYG and PSG managed to wipe BYG off. The last teamfight of the game was lost by Liang of BYG as he was caught off before elder dragon spawned and PSG managed to get a clean ace and finished off the game. A super exciting game and with both sides very even in teamfights, it led to positional mistakes and great flanks from PSG that led to PSG winning this game. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMP 1-0 Boom

&amp;#x200B;

Boom had a great early game, getting 4 towers to IMP's 0 towers and having around a 4k gold lead at 20mins. However, a disastrous baron call by Boom led to a clean ace by IMP and with the baron, they managed to claw back the game and secured the victory afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

ALF 0-1 PSG

&amp;#x200B;

Alpha had a very unusual pick ban by picking Neeko adc and Blitzcrank support and a Yone mid. However, PSG was unfazed by the surprise picks and managed to claim the easy victory over Alpha Esports.",leagueoflegends

I think that the skins work out quite well by themselves (sure, you would have to remodel a bit because of visual clarity and silhouettes, but overall). These are just a few examples that I thought of, because I always thought to myself how similar cryptothralls were to kha'zix' model, so why not make a skin or skin line, that only references Warhammer (Riot could probably also just ask Games-Workshop for full permission to use the trademarks and they would grant it, as this is free advertising).

t3_m3jov0,Implement a new honour/report system,"Hello.

After reading many of your posts, both positive and negative. I’ve come up with a pretty cool idea of something Riot can add into the game that I think might help solve the major issue of teammates being assholes in game and getting away with it because that’s just how league is. (The biggest one would be landers taking jungle camps out of spite for “junglers not doing their job”, whether it was true or not.. of course amongst other things (feeding, raging, toxic, not playing role etc)

If this gets a lot of curiosity I’m willing to post it here, but my question for now is, how do I go about sending my idea to? Should I make a ticket? How can I send my idea to someone who matters.

Thanks!
——————————————————————————
EDIT: I’ve gotten a few messages about my idea so I’m posting it.

Please note that I haven’t really done much research about this so I have no idea if this is a feature in a another game. So as far as I know this is an original idea sparked by all of your hatred towards negative people in game, so thank you. 
——————————————————————————
So here’s my idea that I submitted to RIOT via ticket

Make an in game report system where a vote can be casted against a player. If 3/5 players agree, a warning report message will be sent to the individual DURING gameplay, on screen to warn of their infraction (Person being reported does not see a vote being casted until results are in, receiving the warning if passed) 

Possible threat?? Duo’s This is the reason for 3/5 “agree” vote. 

Yeah but the duo partner can just vote no. True, but his/her duo partner can also warn his/her friend of a vote being casted, and hopefully keep his/her duo calm. This could be a good thing Also, remember the 3/5 votes, so if passed, feedback from the team and the duo could help the individual become more aware of his/her infraction. 

During gameplay, a report ""exclamation mark"" button could be displayed in the tab menu, next to teammates icon/name for a cast vote, or "" /report ""player name""

Post game, during the ""Honor screen"", a report option list of the player that was reported in game could display ""player kept his cool"" or ""player continued infraction"". If the player kept cool, go ahead and actually give him the “player kept his cool” honour. They really do go a long way. 

This could possibly help in the adventure to cleaning up the negativity during gameplay, and maybe keeping the negative attitude players with the negative attitude players. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that you could somehow implement this into the game, or at least sparked an idea of your own. You are more than welcome to use any and all ideas presented to you.",leagueoflegends
t3_m435mm,"The state on the game - Stridebreaker, Galeforce, Immortal Shieldbow.","These three items give overly powerful actives, and the mere fact that they are built as first core item mythics contributes to why these items are so strong. They all eliminate the the main weakness of the classes of champions that build them. 

------

Juggernauts are bulky damage dealers. Their main weakness is being easily kited and slowly chipped away.

* Stridebreaker eliminates this weakness completely by giving them a free gap closer / slow effect. 

Marksmen are high dps, high range, but squishy carries. Their main weakness is enemies that can close the gap to deal damage or cc them.

* Galeforce elminates this weakness by giving them a free escape. 

* Immortal Sheilbow elminates this weakness by giving a powerful shield that blocks crucial burst damage.

-----

For example: Zhonyas Hourglass, Banshee's Veil, Hexdrinker, Quicksilver Sash, Sterak's Guage. 

All of these items also eliminate a big weakness of their builders, but they are also all legendary items with huge downsides for ever rushing them as first items. You lack damage, sustain, and other crucial stats for building these as first items &lt; something that does not happen with Galeforce, Shieldbow, Stridebreaker. They are all **meant** to be built as first core item mythics that offer far sufficient enough stats. 

**Note:** To the counter argument that ""Sheildbow isn't even that strong on most adc's"". The reason for this is simple, Galeforce is just too good to pass up. And even though Galeforce is much stronger, Sheildbow is still used on some adcs which shows how strong it is as well.",leagueoflegends

Also the fact she has to keep Wing to stack tear kind of blows since once again, you're already spending a lot of mana on fishones and it doesnt even help you stack while doing so, it just feels backwards that most of the mana jinx spends in lane is from her Q yet it cant stack any of the mana related item/rune, which just kills any kind of mana building on jinx, when that could possibly be situationally viable in certain games with a simple change like that.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3kilo,Boostrap vs champion bugs in-game,"I've read a couple of blog posts about how improving Boostrap is part of the Client Cleanup.  


And I gotta wonder, wouldn't the whole LoL community prefer this time the developers spend on improving Bootstrap to actually fix the bugs that change outcomes of games cause some bug causes no damage from ability/dying?  


I mean, why focus on Bootstrap when a much more annoying thing is when you do everything you can but game bugs and you die, while otherwise, you would survive and possibly not give up shutdown gold to the enemy team?  


Aren't those exactly the same people that work on improving those two things?",leagueoflegends
t3_m2q1pw,Only four finished mage items give you mana.,"Three of these items are Everfrost, Luden's and Liandry's, leaving the only other option as Seraph's embrace. 

It might just be me, but doesn't this feel silly? I feel like mana has been removed from so many items that you're just forced to take Seraph's every game with a mana-hungry champ, especially if you're not one to build those three mana mythics. It just feels pretty limiting to have to constantly build seraph's just about every game.

I mean, you'd think the **mage** class would have more items that give mages mana. Hell, I'd even take a small AP nerf to plenty of items or an increase in price just to not have to spend 3000G on a seraph's every game.

I don't know, maybe it's just me. What do you guys think?",leagueoflegends
t3_m3ikcg,How to balance AP and AD damge of a teamcomp.,"So i often like to play AP botlanes. But i do care about our team's damage profile..so if we are already heavy on ap,i go adcs.


But lately i have been in a tricky situation. I want to pick ap botlane if our top and jg are ad and even if my mid is ap.


I think of it as a 2-2 ad ap damage. But people often says the carries need to be of different damage. That means if my mid is a carry heavy ap champ, i shouldnt go ap too. 

But doesnt that make 3 ad dmg and 1 ap dmg?

People seem to prefer more ad damages over ap damage. 

What are the ideal scenarios of a balanced damage profile?",leagueoflegends

I wanted to show (off) you the project I have made. It's a program that allows you to play 2 different characters on the game using one keyboard, mouse and display.

There are 2 PC's with running game. Main and second one.The main PC has plugged mouse and the movement of the pointer is tracked and copied on second PC. Left click of the mouse makes second character to move, so you can basically move two characters with RMB and LMB.

Similar situation for the keyboard. Q W E R keys are for main character skills. Keys ""1, 2, 3, 4"" are to control second character skills. Same for Summoners skills - D F for flash/heal, C V for exhaust/heal on second champion.

Everything is shown on below video I made. Sorry for typoes in spelling (LeGends, W, V, etc.) but I was recording without a script, little bit nervous and trying to speak, control recording and use PC at the same time (not so easy :P).

In addition there are many players, being too lazy to dodge and just play the game out with their autofilled role. Guess what happens...game is lost. Whats the result? Toxicity. I mean yes, in high elo it makes sense that you can get autofilled, cause otherwise the queue times would be way too long. But that doesnt count for e.g gold elo.

t3_m2snb9,The upcoming change to Liandry's Anguish shows the fault in Riot's metric for Mythic diversity,"#TL;DR at bottom, since this is kinda long

##The coming changes to Liandry's Anguish:

As most of you probably know, in [Quick Gameplay Thoughts: Feb 26](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-feb-26/) Riot noted that mage mythics were the furthest off their criteria for mythic diversity. As stated in [the following Quick Gameplay Thoughts](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/quick-gameplay-thoughts-march-5/), 10 out of 33 mages missed the criteria. Riot attributed this partly to the fact that

&gt; Liandry's/Luden’s have some of the more “kit synergistic” effects among mythics, which leads to some champs favoring them a bit too strongly.

Now, trying to combat this Riot has made the following changes to Liandry's Anguish items on PBE:

&gt; **Liandry's Anguish**  
[New passive] ""Agony: Deal up to 12% bonus magic damage based on the target's bonus health (maxed at 1250 bonus health).""  
[Removed Effect] ""Whilst burning, they lose 5% Magic Resist per second (max reduction 15%).""

What they've done here is switch out a more universally good passive (15 % magic pen) for a more situationally powerful ability (bonus damage against targets with bonus health). Now at first glance this seems like a good change to increase build diversity - now the relative power between Luden's and Liandry's vary more from game to game depending on the enemy team composition. The problem however is that this isn't really an interesting choice for a mythic item. When Riot [announced the mythic items](https://youtu.be/15EVQpMZhpM?t=112), they described them as

&gt; Mythic items are the the cornestone of your build, with big effects that **define your playstyle** from game to game.

In my opinion, mythic diversity shouldn't come because one item deals more damage than another against a specific enemy team, but because they change your playstyle to one that is optimal in the game. The Marksmen mythics illustrate this concept well.

##How other mythics augment playstyle:
Let's quickly take a look at the role each specific Marksmen mythic occupies in the game:

* Kraken slayer:  High DPS, no self peel or survivability.

* Galeforce: Target access, burst and mobility.

* Shieldbow: Sustain and survivability.

Notice how these mythics shine in different situations, not because they directly counter enemy teams or synergize with specific allies, but instead because **they augment your playstyle to better fit the current game**? Playing against a team with low target access, where you feel relatively safe? Play teamfights front to back with Kraken Slayer, and utilize the increased dps. Does the enemy team have all their damage concentrated on a single carry? Consider going Galeforce and look for picks with a more 'assasiny' playstyle. Even Shieldbow, which is mostly bought against teams with high target access (i.e. assasins), augments your playstyle by turning you into a drain tank and hence letting you go balls deep in teamfights. The point of the Marksmen mythics (as it should be for any mythic in my opinion) is not to directly counter the enemy team, but to allow you to choose a *playstyle* which excels against the enemy team.

I highlighted the Marksmen mythics here, but I think similar trends can be seen for the other mythics too. For the Fighter mythics for example, Trinity Force is a premier splitpushing item with great dueling potential, Stridebreaker gives you the ability to catch people out of position and Goredrinker gives strong teamfight potential and shines in the 5v5 situations. Not all mythics are perfect in this sense, but I think there is no doubt that the mage mythics are in the worst spot in this sense.

##The problem with the change to Liandry's Anguish:
Now how does all this relate to the fault in Riots metric for mythic diversity? The problem is that **the metric only tracks how often the same champion builds different mythics, and this is not directly related to how the mythic augments your playstyle**. Increasing the diversity among mythics is actually super easy - just make one mythic give you a lot of damage against tanks, and one item a lot of damage against squishies. This makes it correct to choose a different mythic from game to game, but this has nothing to do with your playstyle in the given game. Riot should be changing Luden's and Liandries in ways such that they promote different playstyles that excel in different games, rather than having one be good against squishies, and one good against tanks.

I have not mentioned Everfrost yet because I think that item is in a pretty good spot design-wise. Everfrost functions as the premier peeling item, and is hence for when you when you want to play an anti-engage game. Furthermore it can function as a catch item for mages with setup for the active. **Everfrost incentivises you to play in a certain way**. I want Riot to expand on this: My personal suggestion would be to let Liandry's be the premier poke item, let Luden's be the premier burst item, and then add a new mythic which would function as a skirmish item. ~~(I also hate how Riot has tried to make Luden's into a skirmish item on PBE, but it still gives flat magic pen, which is usually something that fits a burst-oriented playstyle, rather than AH. But that is a discussion for another day)~~.

Finally, I would like to note that I actually think the new passive on Liandry's (bonus damage against targets with bonus health) would be great to have in the game - it should just be on a legendary item, rather than a mythic.

#TL;DR:
**The change to Liandry's on PBE artifically bumps up the mythic diversity of mage mythics, by making the item situationally better against tanks. This strikes against the core fundemental of mythic items - mythics augment the players playstyle, and diversity in mythic items should come from the fact that in different games different playstyles are optimal.**",leagueoflegends

I’m a total beginner to the game and I would like to improve, but I’m not sure how because when I played my first game people were being pretty unwelcoming in the chat since I wasn’t good at the game (telling me that I’m bad at the game so I shouldn’t play etc, but I have to start somewhere..)

Is there any way I can play with other beginners or other people who are my level? Any way I can improve without bothering people who are good at the game? Or do I just have to keep playing while being insulted until I manage to be good enough not to be insulted?

Thank you all",leagueoflegends
t3_m3v86s,Why are pro-players still buying 2 Doran's Blades?,"I don't understand why they keep doing it. A 2nd DBlade is only 110% gold efficient, compared to the 1st that is 130% efficient. 

For the same price, they could buy a Longsword and 2 Health pots. That is 10AD, 300HP (one time), and 350g towards an item. Compared to 8AD, 80HP (permanent), and 0g towards an item. 

I think the +220 one-time HP is a lot better after a first back, which is usually when you buy a 2nd DBlade. And +2 AD and getting an item faster is really important too.",leagueoflegends

[This thread was created by the Post-Match Team](https://postmatch.team).",leagueoflegends
t3_m3okys,What ultimate abilities from Heroes of the Storm do you think could fit well in League of Legends?,"There's some really good ones in HotS that could translate rather well into LoL.

Here are a few examples.

&gt;**Apocalypse (Diablo)**  
Create a demonic rune under each enemy Hero on the battleground. After 1.75 seconds the rune explodes dealing X damage and Stunning for 1.75 seconds.

This one might sound OP, but the runes don't move once they're created, so this ultimate is easily avoided unless your enemies are already CC'd or are in a situation where they can't maneuver much. It'd be even easier to avoid in LoL because of Flash if we went with that 1.75 second delay. Still, if used in a Wombo Combo team, it can be devastating by letting your teammates hit their AOE attacks (Diablo's ult does low damage by itself).

&gt;**Purifier Beam (Artanis)**  
Target an enemy Hero with an orbital beam from the Spear of Adun, dealing X damage per second for 8 seconds. The beam will chase the target as they move. Unlimited range.

This one is best used against low-mobility targets or enemies that are CC'd, but even if it doesn't end up dealing much damage it forces the target to keep running. Great for zoning out an important enemy. And even if you say ""Flash can dodge most of it"", forcing your enemy to Flash to avoid this is a win itself.

It might be similar to Viktor's ult, but it doesn't interrupt, has a smaller AOE, and has global range.

&gt;**March of the Black King (Leoric)**  
Become Unstoppable and swing your mace three times, healing yourself for X% of your maximum Health for each enemy Hero hit and dealing Y damage per swing.

This just screams ""juggernaut"". It's easily avoided and punished, but can be very powerful if it hits a cluster of enemies. Generally Leoric wants someone to set him up first, at which point he can come back from the brink of death (so to speak).

&gt;**Poly Bomb (Medivh)**  
Polymorph an enemy Hero, suppressing their attacks and Silencing them for 2 seconds. On expiration, Poly Bomb spreads to other nearby enemy Heroes.

The gimmick to this one is that if your enemies don't spread out, Poly Bomb will keep spreading between them indefinitely. If it doesn't spread at least once, it's a bit weak, but if your enemies are clustered together it's a lot of fun. Varus kinda does this with his ultimate, but his doesn't have the indefinite spread.

&gt;**Lava Wave (Ragnaros)**  
Release a wave of lava from Ragnaros's Core that travels down the targeted lane, dealing X damage per second to non-Structure enemies in its path and instantly killing enemy Minions. Damage increased by Y% versus Heroes.

...Just kidding, this one is completely imbalanceable in League. But still, it's a very unique ultimate ability that lets Ragnaros utterly derail any lane pushes the enemy tries to make. Thankfully it has a long cooldown that the enemy can play around, but in League it would be totally broken due to the gold/item system. Still, one can dream.

t3_m3t9o2,It feels horrible playing Kayle,"She feels garbage. Absolutely useless. I literally don't understand how her kit has not been changed in any way with her literally struggling with a 49% winrate with a 1% pick rate.

What's funny is how she normally had a 50% winrate but now that we overcome the dreadful start of the season with items being far beyond broken, this has then caused a sudden huge spike on Kayle's winrate! So what does Riot do? Nerf her items and Nerf her directly so as a result leading to both direct and indirect nerfs. Now where does she stand from the overwhelming 56%winrate at the beginning of the season? Nay! It has declined a 7% all the way down to 49% winrate proving that she will only be good if an item is meeting her desire thus allowing her to reach her full potential.

I can't even consider this champ as a hypercarry and funny thing is that, I'm not even a huge Kayle main but to all the Kayle mains that somehow picked this version which was a complete failure of a design or maybe not (my opinion) then you completely proved to being one of those mains that had to put up with a garbage early game with an almost garbage late game with horrendous base stats, horrendous scaling, horrendous hp growth, abysmal base defence, horrible mana, horrible damage and is completely useless and afk until most of the game.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3uvtz,Longer attack range for outer top turret,"I have this proposition as a way to help melee (tank/bruiser) toplaners against the recurring ADC picks on toplane. Right now laning phase is very difficult for melee champs to survive. This is worsened by the fact that they even get harassed under the turret without the turret retaliating.

My idea would be to slightly increase the other toplane turret's range to give melee toplaners a bit more breathing space when playing safe. This way no items or champs have to be adjusted.

Do you think this may be a good idea?

Truth.  If I was tilted, and I didn't want to be under any pressure I'd just play that. Unpopular opinion but ARAM is the worst game mode out of ARURF, nexus blitz, one for all and ARAM. I just don't like it. But ARURF is just fun. Infinity mana, low cooldowns, higher speeds, and nobody needs to declare their lane before the match starts like in blindpick, because if you just go to a lane, most of the time you will be in that lane for the early game. The mode also let you try champs you rarely play. I don't know why they'd remove it. Why not just keep it, along with the others in league, server problems? Not enough players playing them? 
Sure they'll probably all be added back later but why not keep them?",leagueoflegends

t3_m2lysj,Rare Atom: A Dark Horse Emerges in the LPL,"**Rare Atom: A Dark Horse Emerges in the LPL**

Heading into the 2021 Spring Split, many were expecting the mostly unchanged rosters of last year’s worlds to dominate. The names of JD Gaming and Top Esports were still those that resonated fear into the hearts of many an LPL player, and yet, things were different. The Top 3 in the LPL (as of week 8) featured none of the 2020 Worlds participants, but rather some of the old titans on the League, RNG and EDG, and most surprisingly of them all a nearly unknown team who have burst onto the scene with 8 straight wins - Rare Atom.

**A New Era**

Who are Rare Atom? If the name doesn’t immediately resonate, don’t worry, it’s not just you. Rare Atom is a newly rebranded organization for 2021, and they were previously known as Vici Gaming. The most surprising part of this process is that while the organization rebranded, the team for the most part remained the same - save for the midlane, the roster that has been fielded this split is the same one that produced an astoundingly mediocre 8-8 series record in 2020 Summer. Now? They sit at 9-3 on the brink of an early playoff lock, with 2 and half weeks left in split regulation.

**A Clash of Potential**

Who could possibly have revived a team like Vici? Star rookies, grizzled veterans, new exciting players? Well...it’s quite complicated. Coming into the split, the expectations for this roster were low. The focal trio of Lu “Leyan” Jue, Hu “iBoy” Xianzhao, and Chu “FoFo” Chunlan were three of the players to have once been considered some of the most mechanically gifted young talents/prospects in League’s history, but all three had come up somewhat short of their expectations with stints on Invictus Gaming, EDward Gaming, and Bilibili Gaming, respectively. Each plagued with their respective serious issues preventing them from reaching their full community-expected potential, they would find their paths crossing here on this Rare Atom roster. 

**To The Moon**

Nobody quite knows how, and nobody quite knows why, but the mentioned collection of three of the highest potential players in the League somehow unlocked something within all of them, and they have played surprisingly well so far this split, far beyond the level anyone would have predicted back in January. Despite being dealt heavy blows from the traditional heavyweights of JDG and TES, they have managed to deal equally crippling strikes to other key top contenders, defeating Suning, Funplus Phoenix, and Team WE. However, in spite of these victories, many remain reserved about this squad, and not without reason - their greatest test still lies ahead of them.

**An Era or An Ephemerality?** 

As previously mentioned, both the pasts and the futures of the RA members is complicated. They have two very young players, support Fu “Hang” Minghang and top laner Dai “Cube” Yi, who certainly have potential to become solid players. But then you look at the rest of the roster. None of their core trio can be called fresh rookies, having all played games at the World Championship, and yet none save perhaps FoFo can truly be called veterans - at ages 18, 20, and 22. A true middle generation, the risks attached to each player is obvious, and yet so is the boundless potential. There are no absolutes, no control variables in this Rare Atom experiment.

This split is the biggest chance all of these players have to live up to what they set out to do. All that stands in their way now - three of the most storied organizations in LPL history. Closing out their season, three of their last four series come against the titans of IG, RNG, and EDG, with the latter two being the first and second placed teams in the current split.

March 13th (IG). March 22nd (RNG). March 28th (EDG). If Rare Atom can shake their past and break out into becoming a top team, these are the dates you must be watching. If they fall short, then their hot run this season may very well may be that of a real split atom - a flash, and then a distant memory.",leagueoflegends

t3_m35j0o,The Minion Block to End All Minion Blocks,,leagueoflegends
t3_m360jg,The Problem with Ability Power,"Ability Power is one of *League*’s gifts to the MOBA genre. It opened up a whole new type of spellcaster scaling that previous games like *Defense of the Ancients* lacked, and has sustained those champions for over a decade now. Yet for all the advantages it brought with it, I firmly believe the current implementation is responsible for many of the issues we see regarding ability power itemization.

As a system, ability power lacks depth. It is only supported by magic penetration -- which has an attack damage equivalent -- and ability haste, which also supports the attack damage system, since many abilities scale on attack damage. As a result the only real tool we have to differentiate the offensive power of ability power items is the amount of ability power granted and how that relates to an individual champion’s ability ratios.

Let’s compare this to attack damage. Every purchase of attack damage grants you damage on auto-attacks, so there is a set baseline value that all characters receive that does not exist for ability power. Attack damage is divided into base, bonus, and total attack damage, allowing us to favor specific characters or styles of itemization when we design items and abilities. Finally, attack damage is inherently linked to the attack speed, critical strike, critical damage, and on-hit systems, giving us a broad range of mechanics we can combine to create role-specific items that are not appealing to those outside our intended design space.

Therein lies the problem. We cannot achieve this sort of role-specific item design with AP anywhere near as easily. We cannot give AP bruiser-focused items high amounts of ability power, because mages and assassins with strong ability power ratios will poach those items and gain increased damage and durability. There is no way to stop this from occurring without specifically designed item passives: we lack the equivalent system hooks to create items like Sterak’s Gage or Trinity Force. Conversely, we cannot give AP bruisers high ability power ratios to compensate for the lower AP their intended items give, or we create scenarios where those bruisers buy mage or assassin items and abuse their high AP ratios for more burst-oriented playstyles (Malphite and Sylas are good examples of this). 

Moving past ratios, we also lack interactions with other subsystems like critical strike or attack speed (save on a few very specific champions), which means we cannot easily leverage the fact that some roles do not care about certain stats to help narrow our user pool. The current solution uses time-in-combat mechanics to limit burst damage potential (Liandry’s, Riftmaker, Demonic Embrace), but it would be far healthier to have a way to address this issue on a system level, as it would allow for more interesting and varied item design -- and many of these existing bruiser items are still frequent purchases on mages and assassins who don’t mind sustained combat.

In short, we have a single mechanic that is insufficient to support the wide range of characters it is intended to support: Artillery Mages, Assassins, Battlemages, Catchers, Divers, Enchanters, Juggernauts, Skirmishers, and even some Wardens and Vanguards all use ability power, and we do not have enough system-level tools to enable healthy AP itemization for this wide a user pool with this broad a range of gameplay without the risk of unhealthy item poaching and the undesirable consequences that can lead to. Finding a way to add depth to the ability power system feels like a necessary change to improve item diversity and system health in the future.

Thoughts are appreciated. Do you agree or disagree? Do you have suggestions or ideas of possible ways to expand the AP system?",leagueoflegends
t3_m3kgp2,On the topic of MS revert the ghost buff that extends its cd on takedowns,Everyone at the time knew these buffs were very niche and seemed cool at the time but would essentially make Darius and Hecarim stronger. And here we are new items that make them faster along with the already broken spell that resets when they kill people abusing these new shitty items. Darius and Hecarim lose all of their weaknesses because every item they have gives ms and if they get a kill they just keep zooming cause the ghost resets on takedowns and if they have nimbus cloak (which they almost always do) they're never slowing down.

t3_m2jtmk,Don't disrespect Gangplank!,"Someone in another thread was besmirching the power of Gangplank. Being the upstanding citizen I am, I wanted to right this wrong. Here is the true power of Gangplank:

Passive: Heat your blade to the point that it can spontaneously cause *any* of the other champions to catch fire. Do you know how hot that is? Me neither but like some of the champs are literally made of metal. That’s gotta burn real hot to catch fire, no? And where does that heat come from? He’s just holding it in his wooden hand, so the only reasonable option is that he is literally adding energy to the universe with enough accuracy to hold it all in his sword. This isn’t the only instance of GP using the god-like ability to disobey the first law of thermodynamics.

Q: Not only does gangplank fire a bullet with insane accuracy, its bullet can apply the same effects his blade can.  Most importantly, gun also has no reload animation so we can only conclude that he conjures a new bullet and the gunpowder to launch it directly in the barely. That’s right, not only does GP create energy from nothing, this motherfucker *creates matter* from nothing. And not in a uncoordinated mess of atoms like that of a newborn star either (unlike a certain star dragon). He literally conjures the atomic structure of black powder along with metals of a bullet in the shape of a ball! 

W: Eat a heavinly orange imbued with the ability to cure any disease or illness and spring the user from any trap, even the gravitational pull of a newborn star.

E: Once again, we see Gangplank’s mastery of his creation abilities. Gangplank conjures an ENTIRE BARREL OF GUNPOWDER. Not only does that mean that he can conjure on a larger scale, but it means he can conjure intensely complex materials like wood. The cosmic dunce can once again just throw a bunch of atoms around willy nilly.

R: Gangplank doesn’t just hold the power of a god, he is a masterful commander, able to lead a fleet of ships large enough to unleash a continuous volley of cannonballs on any area he desires. What’s mr poopdragon’s ultimate ability again? Some gastric distress? Pathetic.

t3_m3s06r,People don't talk about this enough: Season 11 is actually the first season where every role feels good.,"As the title suggests, think about it!

You have:

&amp;#x200B;

TOP LANE:Wide champion pool with an arsenal filled with Bruisers, tanks, and other good jazz.Toplaners can be extremely useful, as for soaking up extreme amounts of damage (For example for a carry jungler), pressuing sidelane, or helping 2v2 fights when your jungler invades. Toplane island doesn't exist anymore, a good toplaner can get your game- ahead easily, and make sure the other toplaner is gold-fodder for the jungler.Even when tanks is not an option, there is still plenty picks that you can utilize, to get the maximum effect of your lanes potential.

Picks like Tf, Seraphine, Karma, Soraka or even Galio is splendid picks to make sure the game goes in the favor of you, because you may not know this, but toplaners have the privilege of being the junglers ROCK.By abandoning CS or even giving up a couple of waves to your 0-3 jungle karthus, you make sure he stays in the game and by all means, will 1v9 or ff trying. If you thought toplane was weak, think again. This role is suited for playing the game right beside your jungler, and winning even the most dire of matches.

Jungle:Massive powerhouse role, undoubtly one of the most oppressive roles right now.As of right now, junglers can:GankDeal DamageOutfarm LanersControl ObjectivesSplitpushRun faster than anyone elseAsassinateTankAnd much more.This role is easily one of the top 5 roles in the game right now.

  
  
Mid:       
Even though midlane has been a little underwhelming this season, there is still hope.You may not be the resource-filled 1v9 machine anymore, and yeah to be honest, you can't really roam because enemy jungler can always 1v1 you... And yeah, maybe picks like mages and scaling stuff doesn't really work anymore because your jungler always first-picks AP twitch and enemy jungler responds with a clean R1 Hecarim, BUT!You have much more power than you think.You have the honor of being your junglers bitch, and you of course excel at champions like galio, tf, karma, seraphine or even soraka. Basically any bitch that can shield your jungler or dismiss CS and go straight to the enemy jungle because your Kindred sadly didn't look to see if you had lane prio when he decided that enemy udyr's red was his for the taking.       
  
  


AD:       
As per usual, ADC is a controversial role, with some people saying it's powerful and others saying its garbage. Who am i to decide. AD has been through a lot, and yeah you can't really pick the traditional crit/dps marksman to the extent you could back in the old days, but some really eye-catching picks to look at, might change what people think about the role:

Soraka, karma, galio, tf, or even Seraphine.You have the honor of being your junglers push-over. Yes, that's an honor!By standing behind your tower (or even T2 if your super jungler pings their jungler bot!) you realise that you effectively stopped a gank from the enemy jungler right? That means your jungler is a camp ahead!By gank 3-4 and when the enemy botlane has gotten a few 4 towerplatings, you can lean back and think about the juicy  enemy krug- and raptor camp that your jungler so mercilessly claimed as his own. You held your own down there, that's absolutely amazing!       
  
  


Support:       
Support is for sure one of the best roles, top 5 at least. Close to the jungler the entire game, wether it being Yuumi on a Blue kayn or a heavy invading bard, you for sure know how to mess up the enemy jungler!Taking advantage of the enemy jungler is, of course, something that your jungler appreciates, as this means he can get a few camps and maybe a wave in midlane, making him accelerate with 10 times the  speed as the enemy Amumu who just got a triple kill botlane.And you know why support is so damn good right now? Because you have the GUTS to be the junglers WINGMAN. You're there for scuttle, when udyr needs you! You're there for the invades at level 1, 3, 4, 5 ,6 and 7. You're there for the midlane ganks, you're there for the drake control, you're probably uber'ing to toplane in this very moment!!By being everywhere, means that your jungler will not have to. Alas, he can farm camps and absolutely destroy the enemy jungler.

I hope this gave a little insight as to why league might not be that bad right now. With all the new items and stuff, im glad that at least all 5 roles are relatively balanced and playable still. Thank you for reading! ;)",leagueoflegends

https://imgur.com/a/HmUgADP


Hey, I just started playing the game frequently again and have been looking forward to getting back into ranked and challenging myself to reach Platinum by the end of the season. I'm 7 games into my placements and nearly 50% of these placements have been some of the worst League experiences of my life. Are Placements notorious for having people who are obviously banned on their mains accounts / buy accounts to troll? I've never seen this before and don't know whether I've just been crazy unlucky but it's worrying because I'm on my way to hitting a 50% WR in placements due to these AFKs and I don't want it to heavily impact my MMR.




The Renekton and Sion game I had somebody go AFK within 10 minutes and the Sion ""Troll"" game I had the Galio on my team decide that he didn't want to lane vs Yasuo and just ran into my lane (after already dying to Yasuo 3 times within 5 minutes) after which he then died twice to the enemy top. Both solo lanes were now fed and this dude was toxic af, probably banned on his previous accs. 




The Jax game 2/11 was definitely my bad. For consideration tho, I was playing against a Fiora smurf (checked their account after the game and they were dropping 20+ kills in each game) and was limit testing my trading from the start and then their Jungle camped me and I just couldn't get back into the game. Note that despite me playing awfully, I still didn't have the most deaths on my team LOL, so it's not like we stood much of a chance in this one.




Please tell me it gets better and this game hasn't gone to complete shit? Sadge",leagueoflegends
t3_m3tma4,Gold is by far the biggest factor in league of legends.,"It's not because items are overtuned, or champions or runes or even team comps.  It's all of those things combined at this point, and there honestly isn't any going back.  Gold is the oil that these machines need in order to work, period.  Champions buy power in this game; if Riot intends to add comeback mechanics, they'll have to largely use gold to do it.

If a champion's ahead, more gold for them is like pouring salt into the open wound of the enemy team. If a champion's behind, every scrap they get matters.  It hardly matters which champion at this point - any of them do some modicum of damage and all of them scale well with at least a few core items.

Riot, please don't focus on changing, rechanging and rerechanging champions, items or even runes for S12.  Change how gold works, and change it to work on a player-by-player basis.  That is all.",leagueoflegends

t3_m2ixf3,"The way we track ""Multiple (2+) champions hit..."" Eternals is changing for Series 2. But, how would you feel about us retroactively applying the same rule to Series 1 Eternals?","Hello Eternals fans! Riot Rovient here, designer on Eternals Series 2.

I love tricky Eternals; the ones that ask you to try that little bit harder to progress. There's something extremely compelling about the *""Multiple (2+) champions hit""* Eternals from Series 1, but, I also found there was something decidedly less cool about them. If the requirement for such an Eternal is ""2+"", such as with Yasuo's *""Multiple (2+) enemy champions hit by Last Breath (R)""* then hitting 3, 4 or even 5 champions at the same time gains you no additional progress or recognition. I'm sure a lot of you have discovered the same thing.

However, in Eternals Series 2, we're going for a subtle but powerful shift in the way we track your performance for these kinds of Eternals, such as with Kayn's *""Champions hit* ***beyond the first*** *with Blade's Reach (W)"".*

This simply means ""Whenever you hit more than 1 champion with this, we'll count them all"". Minimum progress you can get from hitting multiple champions at once is 1, but the maximum is 4! Not *all* Eternals are going to be like this; sometimes it makes more sense to just count occasions when ""It was more than 1"" as a single Eternal increment. But for the most part, *""Champions hit beyond the first""* will be the new standard.

But, **how would you feel if we retroactively went back and applied the same rule shift to Series 1 Eternals** (where it made sense to do so)? It won't make them any easier to obtain, since you'll need to still hit that minimum requirement, but it would occasionally grant you more progress toward the next Milestone when you pop-off. It's worth pointing out that you're almost certainly going to see more progress in this world than before. Does this lessen your achievements so far? Is this a cost worth paying to get the recognition you deserve for landing a 4 champ stun with Ekko's Parallel Convergence?

It should go without saying, but this Reddit poll is absolutely not a binding design agreement between Riot and yourselves. I'm just putting the feelers out there about something I think could be really awesome. If you don't agree then I'll probably downplay my feelings around co-workers tomorrow, saying stuff like ""I don't even really care what Reddit thinks anyway"" with an attempt at a convincing smile, but we all know they're going to see right through me. It'll be embarrassing.

**TLDR: We're making ""Multiple champions hit"" Eternals in Series 2 recognize the times you hit 3, 4 and even 5 champions at the same time. But, how would you feel if we went back and applied the same change to Series 1 Eternals?**

Follow me on Twitter, (@Rovient [https://twitter.com/rovient](https://twitter.com/rovient)) since I frequently post polls there about this kind of thing and it's less effort than writing a Reddit post.

Aldrich The Frozen Flame

**The Flame &amp; The Frost (Passive):**

**Flaming Ground**: An area on the ground that creates a stacking DOT effect on enemies that walk over it and remain in it. Flaming Ground currently has an undefined duration.

**Frozen Ground**: An area on the ground that creates a stacking SLOW effect on enemies that walk over it and remain on it. Frozen Ground currently has an undefined duration.

**Frozen Flame**: Frozen Flame is created when both Flaming Ground and Frozen Ground meet. Frozen Flame is an area on the ground that create stacking DOT, Slow, and a stacking effect that causes enemies to take bonus damage next time Aldrich hits them (cooldown per champion so they do not get spammed with bonus damage)

Aldrich does not use mana, instead his mana bar is replaced with a meter that fills as he deals and receives damage to enemies and slowly decays over time. If The Flame &amp; The Frost’s bar becomes full, Aldrich’s next ability excluding Bow Down to The Frozen Flame will cast both fire and ice versions Simultaneously.

Note: The Effect of Flaming Ground will be like Brands Blaze &amp; The Effects of Frozen Ground will be like Nami’s Tide caller’s Blessing (Subject to change)

**Unyielding Fire / Chill Out (Q):** 

**Unyielding Fire:** Aldrich uses the flames in his feet to dash in a direction, stopping on the first enemy hit. Aldrich will create Flaming Ground in a (undefined radius) underneath the enemy he hits as well as leaving Flaming Ground along the path he just dashed.

**Chill Out:** Aldrich uses the frost in his hands to throw a powerful ice shard. If it hits an enemy, it will create Frozen Ground in a (undefined radius) underneath the enemy he hits and leaves Frozen Ground along the projectiles path.

**Burning Vengeance / Winter Shell (W):**

**Burning Vengeance:** Aldrich grants himself or an ally movement speed and bonus Auto Attack damage for X duration. After completing X Auto Attacks or after the duration Aldrich creates Flaming Ground at the feet of the champion with the buff.

**Winter Shell:** Aldrich grants himself or an ally a shield for X duration. When the shield is destroyed or expires, Frozen Ground will be created at the feet of the champion who had the shield.

**I am the Flame! / The Frost Protects Me! (E):**

**I am the Flame:** Aldrich creates an aura around him, every second he launches a ball of fire at the closest enemy that deals small damage. (undefined duration)

**The Frost Protects Me!:** Aldrich creates an aura around him, enemies outside of this aura deal less damage to Aldrich and his allies inside the aura. (undefined duration) 

**Bow Down to The Frozen Flame (R):**

Aldrich gets one point in his ultimate from level 1, like karma’s ultimate.

Passive: Increases the effectiveness of Flaming Ground, Frozen Ground &amp; Frozen Flame per point in Bow Down to The Frozen Flame. In Flame Stance Aldrich becomes a Melee Champion, in Frost Stance Aldrich becomes a Ranged Champion.

A big Dejavu that costed Liandry's and Luden's huge nerfs at the beginning of the season, till recently were they received 2 buffs in a row.

&amp;#x200B;

Before i explain what rustled my jimmies, i just wanna point out something. Luden's is getting ANOTHER buff, and Liandry's is getting a small rework that, to be honest, is just a buff overall.

I'm just really bitter about the fact that when we look at burst damage, we just keep hitting mage items over and over again, when the midlane tierlist and pickrates look like this:

([https://i.gyazo.com/3d447f161a6a8c43a295531f87076d37.png](https://i.gyazo.com/3d447f161a6a8c43a295531f87076d37.png)) If the image doesn't load.

[u.gg tier list for midlane, all elos, sorted by pickrate.](https://preview.redd.it/hd7a1ngozmm61.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=503fa25f297b6c04651acd428fd0eefd0b613141)

Notice anything? Katarina, Zed, Yone and Yasuo collectively, at ALL elos, in the WHOLE WORLD, have a pickrate of:

# 47.2 PERCENT PICKRATE

It means that FOUR champions alone make up HALF the ENTIRE midlane ranked rooster. **OUT OF 56 picks.**

# Also, before you yell ""BUT THE WINRATE!!!!!!1!1!!!1!!!1!!1!!""

ALL of them are extremely HIGH SKILL CEILING champions, with ABSURDLY high pickrates. Their winrate is **NOT** supposed to look like that.

&amp;#x200B;

[THIS is how an high ceiling champion is supposed to look like](https://preview.redd.it/79ub3506ymm61.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a0bde31dc20ee97cc2422688df125e35c44408f)

&amp;#x200B;

And still on that note, Do you know why there is a ""tier"" next to each champion on both [u.gg](https://u.gg) and [op.gg](https://op.gg)?

Winrate alone doesn't and can't determine the effectiveness of a champion. The meme post about AD Ziggs having a 100% winrate otherwise would be legitimate. Winrate MUST and NEEDS to be looked through PICKRATE. Then you have a WAY more clear effective level of a champion.

&amp;#x200B;

But alas, I'm not here to complain about the fact that midlane's top 10 champions is made up by

7 assassins

&amp;#x200B;

2 mages

&amp;#x200B;

1 fighter

&amp;#x200B;

Im here to complain about the fact that its POINTLESS to claim that there is too much burst in the game and hit items if the ENTIRETY of the champions that make THAT ONE STATISTIC about burst mage is Overpowered. Its POINTLESS TO NERF LUDEN'S if the data that points that there is too much burst in the game is made by KATARINA YONE YASUO AND ZED. They do NOT build ludens.

&amp;#x200B;

Literally ZERO. NONE. Of the champions on that list builds luden's. NOT ONE.

Would Nightharvester be the problem then? Well maybe its the CHAMPIONS to be the problem?Maybe before nerfing Night harvester AGAIN, or Luden's, MAYBE its time to actually look at the stats for the midlane and fix this ATROCITY of assassin only meta?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Midlane is composed only by assassins with various and diverse mythics, that alone should already tell that the problem is NOT the items but the champions.But considering that riot thought Katarina, S+ tiered champion with an overall 52% winrate and a 12% pickrate was due a buff last patch, I have absolutely NO hope to EVER play Ziggs, Veigar or Swain in the midlane ever again.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3jydr,"The Issue with Franchising - the birth of ""developmental"" rosters","Hi there fellow League of Legos degenerates,

With all the talk surrounding everyones favourite worst NALCS team, Golden Guardians, I thought I'd throw my 10 cents into the discussion. I've been following competitive league of legends avidly over the past 6 or 7 years, as it combined my newly found love for the game after living in Korea for a year with my love for competitive sports. As a football (soccer for you American heathens) fan that's been watching the Premier League for as long as I can remember, I could never really get my head around the franchising system that League of Legends was so quick to implement across most of the major reasons in the world. I know that Franchising is the common system in NA, and I thought I was just missing the point, but the more I think about the NALCS, the clearer it is to me that a league system, as found in European football, would work better.

Why?

1. The benefits of getting to the top division and staying there means teams are incentivised to put together good ""rosters"". Teams that aren't willing to invest or put together a sustainable strategy for success will naturally sink to the bottom, whilst those that do will float to the top.
2. It gives smaller teams/lower ranked teams something to play for. Ergo, providing lesser known/younger players with more competitive opportunities and experience. A meaningful replacement to the Academy system.
3. Having a promotion/relegation battle provides amazing excitement - who doesn't love a story about fighting for survival or the elation of small team making it to the big time? Inter-league cups also provides the opportunity for David vs Goliath storylines that could help unveil new star players.

Ok, but what issues is the franchising causing?

Developmental rosters. To me, announcing a ""developmental"" roster was just marketing speak for ""we're going to announce a team that we know cannot compete at this level, but there are no real penalties for doing so and we need to save money, so how do we market this thing?"".  They held up the white flag before the race even begun. I'm not a Golden Guardians fan, but this must have sucked.. Seeing your team go from playoff contenders to a team that would struggle in Academy over night and I can't help but think that there is no way this would have happened if it weren't for the protection that franchising gives teams.

Would they have allowed another team in the same division to poach a successful roster from under their noses without having good replacements lined up? Would they have allowed star players to head into the last year of their contract without either selling them on for a profit and reinvesting or having a clear plan for who would replace them?

Unless they were purposefully trying to tank out of the league, of course not.

Fans follow teams to ride the rollercoaster of highs and lows that is competitive sports. To me, Franchising brings this down.

What's the point in doing it at all if you don't have the ambition to succeed?

Am i missing something?

Lots of love, your average league of legends degenerate.",leagueoflegends
t3_m3jxu2,PSA: if your comp outscales and your team is behind STOP forcing fights and try to get into lategame,"Why can't people understand how comps work?   

If your team has a Vayne Lulu against a Swain Tristana is TOTALLY normal they lose early pressure, plates and even tower. They can't ever contest the 2 v 2 match up. All Vayne and Lulu can do is sitting under tower and trying to scale.   

I'm not even asking junglers to camp the lane, but if you can't understand you shouldn't be forcing UNNECESSARY fights until your comp is online, you have a problem.  

Let your carries get farm, play around vision, defend the nashor, defend the soul drake, but DON'T force fights when your composition is clearly WORSE.

t3_m3q2hg,There is a big problem with tagging mid in normal draft,"I think there is a problem with the proportion of midlaners who end up being offrole in normal draft (at least in my elo, \~gold mmr)

Depending on the second role you choose, you will be at least offrole 2 times out of 5, or even 4/5 if you pick something like jungle.

From my experience, that create a big big issue in a gamemode like normal draft. First, it should be a gamemode where you can try new champs before picking them in ranked, once you are familiarized with them. The problem is that you will at best be able to play them 2 times out of 5, so their is a pretty big amount of midlaners who prefer to go in ranked in order to master their champs cause they will have the midlane most of the time. 

On top of that, when you come back from a long day at the office/school, you will usually only have time for one, maybe two games of league. Because you are tired you will probably go in normal. The problem is that in 50% of these game (wich are the only games you play) you are not gonna playing what you want. When i only play one game of league per day i want to play it on my mainrole

&amp;#x200B;

t3_m3i7a0,Its disappointing that Riot is moving away from juggernauts with complexity and niches,"Or at least some degree of nuance to their kits.

I think it started with Urgot; in both VGU versions there really wasnt much to him other than exerting more of a power fantasy than a gameplay niche being filled. Not a very engaging design, theres not much to improve on or consider with him when you're playing it. And then it just kept getting worse; Mordekaiser, Sett, Volibear, all champions who just totally lack any semblance of engaging gameplay. More upsetting to me personally is how generic they feel; nothing about them pops out, they feel like derivatives of existing designs. In particular I think what rubs me the wrong way is that they all had pretty cool identities before their VGU and feel a lot more homogenized now.

For me, the best designs came out S5-S6. CertainlyT's Mordekaiser. Yorick. Illaoi. They had clear mastery curves, they were very rewarding to put time on. They had *distinct* identities and both did things, and went about doing those things, in ways that were totally unique to them. This is the direction i assumed juggernauts were going to go, and these plus Darius are the designs that got me into the class.

I think it's intentional; Riot likely well understands that the former group appeals more to the average juggernaut player (who just wants a standard raidboss power trip and isn't interested in anything fancy) and better marketability means they can sell those concepts more easily. But it would be nice to see another champion put in the pool of the latter, at least to compensate for Mordekaiser being shifted into a low mastery pick.

Thoughts?

Bonus question: what do you think about Mundos upcoming rework?

t3_m3dnyy,Players with special names in champion select,"When I used to play League, I remember seeing a guy with a gold name in champion select. Additionally, there was another guy who could add emojis to his name and keep changing them every 2 seconds. How did they do that?",leagueoflegends
t3_m3dijc,"With the constant shifting of power and change of mechanics, current items will lead back to champions only having 1 viable build","Whats the point of revamping the entire item system for not being diverse or versatile enough, if anytime a champion finds a new build it gets nerfed to bits?

You have to decide. Either I am free to build as I wish and collect the combat stats I want for my play style, or I can only build 1 way and be locked out of other things.

It sucks when you play something and you know the build is going to be subpar, because the math no longer makes sense.

If I play Riven for instance, I have options. Its the nature of my champion. I can go Bruiser vs tanky comps. Lethality vs 1 threat comps and Crit vs low CC comps. Thats versatility.

Same with champions like Renekton. 

I feel like we had more item diversity with the previous system. Pros on Gangplank went Liandries 3rd item. Because Gangplank does not actually scale past 2 items in the current day. It made your ult insane for teamfights with Deaths Daughter and Fire of Will.

Now you cant experiment like that because the item is locked behind a Mythic tag and you want other Mythics or else you are useless.

If a champion like Caitlyn who always goes crit ADC, finds a Lethality build with Dark Harvest, and snipes people thats okay. Its part of the game and its fine. 

Dont panic and nerf Caitlyn, and then nerf Lethality, and then leave Crit Caitlyn dogshit. There are many examples of this happening.

I dont know if many know this but the LCS caster Phreak had a series on his youtube channel discussing champion combat stats. They were 50 minute videos at times but they were really interesting. 

He talked about normalizing champions base combat stats into categories. I dont remember it 100% so im paraphrasing.

If we have 5 tiers of tankyness, then a true tank like Ornn, Maokai and Sion are tier 5. They should have the most armor and MR and HP.

In that same tier, it makes sense that squishier champions like Jinx and Sona are tier 1, the lowest amount of Armor, MR and HP.

Ornn and Maokai would start with the same combat stats. Same as Jinx and Sona.

And this would continue for every aspect of the game. Meaning that every support like Sona, would start level 1 with just as much Armor and MR like Nami, because they are the same.

Meanwhile Pyke and Rakan would have slightly higher stats as Melee champions because they would be tier 2 on tankyness.

Essentially what all of this does, is makes it easier for Riot to balance, because it would be more difficult for champions to step out of line.

You can no longer have a scenario like Jax recieving random armor buffs and build full damage and have more armor than Renekton who has 1 armor item. They would be the same tier.

The only thing allowed to be different about the champions are the champions themselves. You should not be limited in what you can build and do, based on the fact that other champons outstat you from the beginning.

You wont hear the ""Why would you pick Sona instead of Seraphine"" as often. The kits are different, but base stats start out the same.

If they keep going as they are right now, you will have 1 build for 75% of champions, and the rest are able to switch it up based on the game. 

Then we are back to square one.",leagueoflegends

Have you ever wondered why Stridebreaker shows up when you search ""ap"" in the item shop's search bar? Probably not, but I did yesterday. It turns out that's due to the ""colloqialism"" system, which is still in use (and updated) after the shop has been rebuilt - an alternate search term for Stridebreaker is the ""kneec**ap**per"".

-

This system is used primarly for search associations that aren't part of the item name or primary stat tags, such as abbreviations, former names, common misspellings and a few references just for fun.

-

The following list contains the alternate search terms for every item in the game, but here's a few

#Highlights:

* Both Liandry's and Morellonomicon show up when searching ""last shadow"" (but only Liandry's when searching ""ls""), a reference to u/imls.

* * [Post regarding his reaction is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/m1ymei/ls_gets_emotional_after_discovering_searching_his/) I'm very happy to hear that this made his day!

* The ""spooky ghosts"" tag from Twin Shadows lives on in Aether Wisp.

* There are 4 items tagged with ""red"", and 4 tagged with ""blue"". In-game, ""red"" wins by a landslide, though, because anything under *cooldown* ***red****uction* also shows up.

* Rabadon's Deathcap was originally revealed as Banksy's Deathcap, named after a Riot Games employee. This reference has survived to this day.

* Winged Moonplate is tagged with ""pants"" because of a common point that League's shop used to have no legwear items.

* Only some of the anti-heal items show up when searching for ""grievous"" (Bramble Vest, Thornmail and Putrifier are missing), no item shows up when searching ""wounds"", or ""gw"".

* Edge of Night shows up when you search for ""spellshield"", but not Banshee's Veil

* Nami and Cassiopeia have lost their ""hat"" search interaction (was previously managed via adobe flash). :(

-

No item icons on old.reddit this time because the subreddit hasn't updated those in their stylesheet yet.

Once again, special thanks to u/FrankTheBoxMonster for exporting this data so I just had to parse it.

**Edit:** There's actually a bunch more tags from the old system that get fed into the new one which we missed originally. Added them in *italic*.

**Edit2:** Another two updates were in 11.5 to Amp Tome and in 11.4 to Silvermere Dawn. Those are the only updates, marked them in **bold**. This should be everything now.

t3_m2tlfi,LFL is live with their last gameday of the regular season now with three teams tied in the top spot rn and a very close race for EUM and high chance for tiebreaker games,"The french ERL, the LFL, is now live with their last gameday and there are currently Karmine Corp, Misfits Premier and Team BDS all at 12-5 and a 1-1 in h2h tied at first place.

GameWard in 4th is also only one win behind and plays against KC, so there is another tiebreaker possibility there with Vitaliy Bee in 5th who are another win behind and 1-1 in h2h with GW.

t3_m23bvz,S11 Trinity Force changes was a giant flop!,"**TLDR**: Trinity force was changed so more champions could use it. But now nobody builds it and the only primary users feel bad building it. The item lost a ton of stats, it's gold efficiency is abysmal and its identity is flawed...

These are the Trinity Force users in  S10: **Darius, Garen, Camille, Fiora, Jax, Irelia, Trundle, Yorick, Gangplank, Nasus, Ezrael, Corki and some others**.

Even if it had mana, it was still a solid item on non-mana users and it used to be a strong 1-item spike.   
Come season 11 and it is changed to widen the user base by:

* Adding ramping base AD and flat 25 movespeed for Basic Attacks only.
* Removing mana
* Mythic Passive: 10% Attackspeed per legendary so users don't need to worry about attack speedin their build.
* Reducing price -&gt; Which results in weaker stats:  
( -50 HP,  -5 AH, -5% Flat Movespeed, -5% Attack speed, -60 Movespeed rage passive, -250 Mana)

**The item arguably lost around 800-1000 gold worth of base stats while being reduced by only 400 g in price.**

The results? : The item has been completely abandoned by the majority of intended users...

The S11 users are now: 

* **Camille**
* **Jax**
* **Irelia (Shieldbow is better)**
* **Hecarim (Tank or Sunderer is better)**
* **Yorick  (Sunderer is better)**
* **Nasus (Sunderer is better)**
* **Gangplank (Shieldbow is better).**

**Every single s11 user has a mana pool.**

And even the 2 primary users don't feel good building it: the mythic passive is bad, the item gives too little AD and tankiness and the ""powerspike"" feels really underwhelming compared to other fighter mythics.

Why is it called a ""**duelist**"" item.. it has no tankiness, no shield nor any built-in sustain.  
In terms of dueling it is completely outclassed by **BORK** and **Shieldbow**. 

At this point it's just completely overpriced burst item for autoattackers sitting at 85% gold efficiency... The item needs some changes

T**hese are some of my ideas for QoL changes to this item:**

* Mythic Passive +3 AD +3% AS +33 HP per legendary 
* Spellblade heals for 33.3% of the bonus damage as health (like Sunderer)
* Threefold strike should stack on basic attacks **AND abilities** (+3% base AD) and make it 12 stacks so it goes hand in hand with conqueror.
* \+30 Bonus AD (The item is a MYTHIC, not a pickaxe!)

These changes would make more champions use the item, the primary users would feel better and the duelist identity would be preserved.",leagueoflegends
t3_m3i89n,Why does being nice during champion selection gets you punished?,"I'm quite tired of actually trying to be helpful during champion selection by first picking for someone, to get utterly trolled, and having the option of either dodging or play riven as a support. Yeah sure, Riot implemented a report button during cs, but how is that helpful if you still lose lp and they still get away with it?",leagueoflegends
t3_m3rohr,Some nerfs for the strongest role in the game,"ADC is absolutely nuts right now and can basically 1v9 every game they want. I think a few nerfs to the role as a whole is needed.

1. Base stat nerfs. Riot slowly buffed the base stats on marksman again after nerfing them a couple years ago. Base health, base AD, base armor, and base MR could all use some nerfs to make them dependent on support again in lane.

2. Crit damage nerf. Riot was on the right track in preseason but crit damage still needs to be toned down. I think changing crit to 150% damage would be the right move and better balance ADC DPS for late game.

3. Marksman mythic nerfs. This is the last nerf I think is needed. The marksman mythics are way overtuned right now and all 3 probably need nerfs. Increase the cooldown on Galeforce dash and nerf the damage. Kraken's true damage autos need a decent nerf as well. Finally Shieldbow's shield should be nerfed for ranged champs and buffed for melee to increase build diversity for bruisers.

I think with those changes ADC will be balanced again instead of blatantly OP like they are now.",leagueoflegends

Last split RNG is out of the playoff picture, yet now I see an Uzi-less RNG at 1st place, Xiaohu is suddenly a toplaner, and they look like they have a full map gameplan. Wei’s game sense is just insane (man’s in my kitchen stealing my chickens) and GALA looks like just good enough an adc to be amazing when paired with a god like Ming. Cryin I’m not so sure about quite yet, but I know a lot of people are also hyping him up a ton.

I know this is pretty controversial to ask, but is RNG actually better off without Uzi? Like they seem so much better when they play around their whole team, or would Uzi instead of GALA on this roster just easily be a Worlds favorite?",leagueoflegends

t3_m3fiqp,Kayle stat right now and some mini rework idea that will make her a little more fun to play,"Hi I am a kayle main with 1.2 M point on her sorry in advance for the bad English. 
Let me start by saying kayle was never intended to be a support. Never will she work in a support role. 
From all of us at kayle mains please make her the late game hyper carry she is intended to be.  

What if we changed Kayle's R to be like Gate of Babylon? (Gilgamesh, FSN) Instead of the AoE damage she gets 10 swords that target the person she autoattacks - like Syndra R. 

Also get rid of her dual healing on w as well as the pacification on her ulti. This would shift her from a support to a solo laner, and we could also have her R go on a longer cooldown if she ults someone besides herself.

t3_m3pm0i,"I don't feel like Zyra, Vel'Koz, Swain and Brand should be viable supports","Please be aware that this post was written after dozens of games where I, a low elo support player, was matched against these horrible champions that, in my mind, aren't balanced to be in the support role.

What exactly makes them supports anyway? All three of these also have it VERY easy to just do my job better than me in every single way no matter what I play even when they're massively behind. Even if I focus on building only MR with appropriate runes, this extremely behind Zyra magically finds a way to oneshot me at 9th minute.

I understand that everything is pretty much viable anywhere in silver/gold elo, but why are these four so fucking oppressive, when all they're supposed to do is cover the ADC and serve up kills on a silver platter for them? These champions legit make me want 4 ban slots.

t3_m3cchq,A support main P.S.A,"Before adc mains get butthurt over reading this I want to clarifey a couple things.
I like everyone else, am not perfect and fuck up just like the rest of you. Everyone fucks up, everyone makes mistakes. 

Let me proc my relic charges you selfish fucks.
 
You have wards to, use them. I can not ward the entire map and only place 3 at a time. 

I can not stop point and click abilities, stop spam pinging me just because the zed ults you.
 
Just because I poke does not mean i want you to go all in.

Contrary to popular belief, the world does not revolve around you. League is a team game.
 
The moment you start to spam ping me for accidently taking a kill or not landing a skill shot, I will roam and never come back, I'd rather spite you for the rest of the game than win a norm.
 
I will not tank morg q's, thresh hooks, ect just because you cant walk slightly to the left/right. If I do tank them for you, theres A 90% chance i'll still get pinged by you with *gg dumb af sup cant dodge* in all chat.

Im not going to stand in front of you all lane if it means im getting poked down by autos/enchanters all lane while you do nothing. 

Last hitting minions when you are not in lane/dead is NOT taking farm or pushing lane especially if its under tower. 

Supports are not responsible for picking a tank. If a sup plays a tank they are not comfy on because you all pressured them to pick one, then you have 0 right to complain about misplays. There are good reasons why people dont want to play tanks anymore. 

My spells and abilities have cooldowns just like every other spell in the game, I can not have cc/shield abilities up just because you want it to at any given moment. 

If you dont see the jg/mid roaming from 2 wards away even when spam pinged, then you have 0 right to complain that I didnt try to save you. Better one dies then both of us. 

When sups go to ward bushes for the love of god, dont walk up 2v1 and except to live, play safe for 2 seconds ffs. Giving up 2-3 minions for the sup to place wards is better than getting said minions but dying in the proccses.

Following up on jg ganks is more important then half a wave of farm end of story. Ganks dont have to always result in kills, getting the opponent to use sums while you still have you're sums gives you so much safety and pressure, quit pinging the jg if a gank doesnt net kills.  

Im sorry that ignites takes kills but thats no reason to spam ping, better to get some gold than no gold 

If supports manage to cc the carries, ffs dont just sit there, follow up. 

No I can not roam across the map like pyke can, listen to mia pings and ward 

Supports should not be the only ones buying control wards 

Tank supports are not as tanky as they once were, we can not tank 5-6 tower shots 
early on, quit acting like they can 

Enchanters are not tanks 

Supports are poorer then ever right now, stop acting like we can just buy the items you want us the have right away just because you demand it.

We no longer have our outer tower, WHY ARE YOU PUSHED SO GOD DAM HARD?????

For fucks sake stop complaining about supports not peeling/saving you WHEN YOU DASH AWAY FROM US (lookin at you kia mains).",leagueoflegends
t3_m35wba,My personal rework of Sylas: (Maybe i'm going crazy),"It would divide the passive into two components, transferring the damage to the basic attacks and leaving Petricite Burst only as an ataq speed steroid, allowing attack speed build possibilities with Nashor and Berserker's Greaves as item options but maintaining the possibility of using the classic build.

Base status:

Mana: 280 -&gt; 350

Passive:

Shackles of Belief: Sylas' basic attacks deal 100% AD + 25% AP magic damage on hit.

Petricite Burst: After using any ability, Sylas' next basic attack will be in area and Sylas receives 80% bonus attack speed, this effect stacks up to 4 times.

(Removed: Petricite Burst no longer deals damage)

(Removed: No longer deals reduced damage to monsters and minions)

(Removed: No longer disables Sylas 'critical strikes' bonus damage)

(Modified: Petricite Burst Timer: Same for all stacks -&gt; individual per stack)

(Modified: Attack speed buff duration: Petricite Burst duration -&gt; 4 Seconds)

(Bugfix: No longer loses all Petricite Burst stacks)

(Modified: On-target cooldown: 200% of target's ultimate cooldown -&gt; 150% of target's ultimate cooldown)

(New: After using Hijack, Sylas' next Petricite Burst grants him an adaptive shield based on the enemy's damage type, shield power is 100% AD + 25% AP + ultimate base damage stolen, if the ultimate stolen has no base damage a default value of 50/100/200 based on Hijack's level is added)

(New: When using Hijack, Sylas reveals his target for 2 seconds)

(New: When using any ultimate, Sylas reveals enemies hit by her for 2 seconds)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Some explanations:

The idea is to make Sylas less dependent on Haste, which is why escalations with attack speed and damage in all standard basic attacks.

Explanation of the changes:

Attributes:

Just more mana in the beginning so that Sylas has the freedom to use runes and items that don’t grant mana, in the same way that many champions who spend mana also don’t use it, like Irelia, Talon, Urgot, Evelynn, Ekko, Camille, Fiora, Illaoi, Jax, Jarvan, Jhin, Kayn, Lucian, Nidalee, Nasus...

Passive:

Transferring Petricite Burst damage to normal auto attacks facilitates the Sylas farm, in addition to having a better synergy with Conqueror, Legend: Alacrity and attack speed attribute, in addition, the attack speed buff of Petricite Burst remains for 4 seconds after the stack is consumed.

Petricite Burst now only transforms a basic attack that would be an isolated target in an area attack and grants attack speed.

Q:

Just changes to have synergy with the new passive and damage balanced in both parts.

W:

Reduced damage as it now applies hit effects, making it weak in the beginning and strong as it closes items, such as Nasshor and Lich Bane.

Heal reduced due the change in R.

E1:

Just adjust the mana cost.

E2:

Reduced damage but the projectile's speed now scales with Attack Speed ​​and Ability Haste, slow and predictable at first, fast as you buy items.

Now it has the same mechanics as Amumu Q, following the target even though it moves its position, but it has a limit.

R:

Now grants a shield based on the passive damage + base damage of a stolen ultimate or if the stolen ultimate does not have a base damage value a fixed value is added based on the level of R.

Sylas does not have his own ultimate, at least with the shield he can make good use of his R.

The shield is based on the type of damage of the enemy, equal to the passive of Camille, therefore, it only defends a type of damage to each use. Also with the shield being on the R Sylas he will use it less often and he only defends one type of damage per use.

Additionally Sylas reveals his enemy whenever he uses his R or a stolen R, this fixes one of the defects of the champion where he cast R and the enemy entered the fog of war making Sylas lose the ultimate that was not executed and entered on CD.

Now about his CD mechanic by champion it makes a lot more sense for a jungler than a laner, however, there are ultimates that work better in Sylas' hand than in the original champion (For example: Gnar), Maintaining this mechanic is necessary but waiting twice as long as the enemy's laner doesn't make sense. 200% of target's ultimate cooldown to 150% looks good.

Finally, as Hijack now grants a shield, it makes sense to increase his mana cost and decrease his range.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3i4pr,Everfrost is not a balanced item and its active is not the only problem.,"So we all know by now that Everfrost replaced two other items – Hextech GLP-800 and Rod of Ages.

And this is where we need to stop.

**Those two items where serving two different purposes** – Rod of Ages where suppose to give you health and mana so you can survive longer in fights and thats why it was good on late game champions and battle mages, and GLP was giving you more safety and utility for the price of less burst (oftnely paired with Glacial Agument and Twin Shadows so even less damage in order to bring utility). GLP was high range so it synergized very well with high ranged champions but it was giving no health so mages were still very squishy. GLP was built on AP supports (Zilean, Morgana, sometimes Zyra, Swain and Lux) and some mid lane mages (Ahri, Neeko, Veigar and sometimes you could see it on Syndra or Sylas).

**Those two items were built on completly different champions and for different cases and now we have 2 in 1.**

Why Everfrost is it bad?

Becasue it’s just not okay that long ranged champions like Ahri and Neeko can build 250 health form mythic then Cosmic Drive for another 200 HP and that paired with Zhonya’s or Banshee’s makes them really tanky – they have high range so the fact that they are easy to kill should be their weakness. And for the same reason this is not okay for champions that have a lot of sustain and/or burst to have an item that gives them hard CC and safety at the same time. Everfrost is mid ranged item and its insane on champions that have short or mid range like Kassadin, AP Shaco or Sylas and they also can build Cosmic Drive that gives them additional health and Zhonya’s or Banshee’s. It’s just not right.

It’s really hard to react to invisible Shaco Everforst, Kassadin is already hated champion for his late game burst so why on earth can he build an item that gives him utility and Sylas healing paired with all this HP and Everfrost root and his stunn is so tilting to play against, it’s not even funny.

**Bring back Rod of Ages as an legendary item and GLP as an Mythic item.**

Having GLP as an Mythic item that gives you long range slow but no health is a great option for long range mages because it can be used in a offensive or deffensive way but also gives utility so AP supports will have more Mythics to choose from and it will also give more options to mid lane mages as well. Having a long range slow is already strong so additional health and root is not needed but overall it’s more balanced because while having more safety and utility you have less damage and you are still easy to kill if you misposition. Having GLP back will bring Glacial Agument back which was amazing on champions like Ahri, Neeko and Veigar and was also used on AP supports but now this rune is only used on Senna.

We will have Luden’s for burst, Liandry’s for tanks and GLP for utility/safety.

At the same time bringing Rod of Ages back as a legendary item will give champions like Ryze, Aurelion Sol or Kassadin more options on which Mythic item they can choose, because right now they are mainly building Everfrost. Having Rod of Ages will give them opportunity to build Rocketbelt, Night Harvester or even Riftmaker.

**Bringing back Rod of Ages as an legendary item and GLP as an Mythic item will give a lot of champions more build options and this is what Riot wanted new items to be.** Also it will remove insane things like having hard CC, burst and health on the same item. It’s just so not fun to play against.

Also if there are any mistakes in spelling etc. I’m sorry but English is not my first language. I hope you understand.",leagueoflegends

t3_m3bd4f,Can't close out games as jungler this season,"Currently G3 with peak P2 the last time I seriously tried to climb back in Season 9. Solo player. I've been playing a lot of WW and Kayn recently, using them to create huge map pressure and presence in my attempt to climb back up to the rank I think I am at. Wildcard Eve pick if we need ap or lots of squishies(I should pick up Shaco here). Lee, J4, Nunu, Shyv, Vi, K6, Olaf, Hec are all champs I have in my roster that I would be comfortable playing at plat level depending on their strength each patch.

Anywho, it's as title says. I'm in the zone of doing super well in the early game to mid; fast, nice clears in anticipation of the best lane to gank or countergank, maybe invade. Secure a few kills, a few assists, all with minimal, necessary deaths if any. Drags come up and I use the lead or openings to secure them. Sneak or take Rift when available and we have good map pressure. Typically my team gets first blood on turrets and maybe we whittle and take more down as our lead seemingly snowballs from there.

Then I believe my team starts to crack once we need to coordinate more on our lead. Random deaths happen or have been happening steadily on my laners from fighting. Top thinks he can solo/dive the full hp nasus way past post 6. Mid getting fancy with his solo dives, secures a kill, but still ends up dying in a 1v3 to yas or yas#2. Supp roaming everywhere, drunk on the power from our lead, and gets caught out by seraphine and crew. All kinds of ""wtf why are we throwing this"" moments that make me realize how powerless I am to stop it. Pinging only does so much.

Then I stop and realize, no wait, that Nasus is absolutely deletable, he's just scaled more on his q and has items. That yas or yas #2 is on his 0/10 powerspike, of course he's a threat. The Seraphine has her full kit unlocked and items to fuel it. And their adc is finally catching up and benefitting from their KP so that's threatening as well.

It's all very specific ""meme"" shit from these 200 years overloaded kit champs, but still very real for me and not coming from just those champs mentioned either.

Generally speaking, we win/win hard, then fall off. As if our lead is artificially erased from surprisingly poor solo-engage choices in hindsight, a lot of trades (which are bad at this point obv), or outright insane scaling that sway teamfights in their favor. I know I make my own 2iq iron plays once in a while and I know I'm learning from them with each match played. But still over 100 matches in I am stuck where I started swinging from G2 to G4 this season. And these are the ""good"" matches, not the ones that have 1+ lanes die before my first clear and it's a hard struggle to help someone carry.

**TLDR;**

***As a jungler this season I feel I am speed running ""match security"" knowing that in the end we will start losing the further along the game gets and it is something I have never felt so often before in any season playing this game. I'd rather get pinged for losing back in 2:00 scuttle crab meta and spammed ""jg diff"" by my laners than have it pinged and spammed at me now. I almost don't know what to do anymore this season. Has anyone else experienced this or something similar?***

t3_m24ez0,Seraphine is a traumatized lunatic looking to unite Piltover and Zaun to create a dystopian escapist society,"In my post about Gragas, I said that he was an outlier from other champions in terms of lore and ability consistency along with another champion. And that champion was Seraphine.

Seraphine's ability kit doesn't line up with her personality and goals at all. At least that's not what it seems like at surface level. Here's why Seraphine is a deranged lunatic looking to unite Piltover and Zaun for her own selfish escapist fantasies.

(This post is satire, made to make fun of Seraphine's lore and abilities in game. Please don't take this too seriously.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Soul Reading Trauma and Splintered Psyche**

Imagine if you could read everyone's mind as if they were talking out loud, and you couldn't turn it off. That's most likely what it was like for Seraphine as shown in her biography. This means at a very young age, Seraphine was probably hearing things like Camille's violent thoughts about the scum of Piltover as she beheaded three people at once, the depressive episodes of literally everyone other than Jayce in Clan Giopara, and Vi's barely contained bloodlust. This incessant ringing noise of thousands of souls all screaming their opinions at her never stops for even a second. She even dreams of other people's dreams too since she can hear their souls directly, which means this cacophony doesn't even spare her while she is asleep. When Seraphine gets her dampener, she goes to the crystal for guidance because she is "" Overwhelmed by the yearnings around her, she worried she may have no song of her own"". This sentence seems innocent enough, but read it again without your eyes closed and you'll realize that since songs are the literal expression of your soul, Seraphine can't hear her own soul because she can only hear the thousands of other peoples'. Back to the mind reading analogy, imagine not being able to discern your own personality anymore because of how many personalities you've witnessed firsthand. After all this trauma, there's no way Seraphine comes out of this living hell years later a shallow and loving optimist who aims to reunite Piltover and Zaun without any underlying ulterior motive. This outward personality is only a mask that Seraphine uses to further her goals. More on that later.

&amp;#x200B;

**Miraculous Cure and Crippling Dependence**

To help Seraphine and her wasteland of a mental state, her parents crafted a special dampener that helped her control her powers. The brackern inside this dampener showed Seraphine ""distant deserts and ancient conflicts of ancestors, a thousand years of history sang in unison "". Now this dampener was crafted from a ""rare"" hextech crystal. The only reason a hextech crystal would be rare is if the brackern that it was harvested from was some form of special nobility that was more powerful or held more information than the average brackern. So Seraphine goes from suffering from her special power straight to the opposite end of the spectrum and witnessing her power being used by a powerful brackern to unify an entire fucking society. This kind of experience is completely unfathomable to us, but lets use the mind reading analogy again. Imagine if everyone in your head just started orchestrating 200 years worth of National Geographic episodes all while providing the soundtrack, sound effects, and mental images to go along with it. I'm sure anyone would kill to experience that on a grander scale again. And that's exactly what Seraphine would go on to do.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extremist Unification and Brainwashing**

Having experienced the human equivalent of the ultimate high, Seraphine's already broken mental state latches onto this one goal with a sort of parasitic longing and need. You can see this mental state driving her actions when Seraphine learns to control her power without the dampener and mitigate her suffering, then proceeds to take apart her dampener and use it to make an amplifier. This not only makes her powers bother her more, but is more evidence of Seraphine's desire being so strong that she doesn't give any shit about her mental state anymore. She will unite Piltover and Zaun through her music, performing with her powers amplified to get everyone in her audience to experience this same unified resonance and join her cause. The simple facade of wanting to unite the two cities for their own good is all that's needed for her audience to see her only as a naive songstress trying to do the impossible with only her singing. If Seraphine truly wanted to unite the cities for their own good, she would have just sung normally and not held herself up as the sole source of the sense of unity that people can feel between the two cities. Everyone knows that Piltover and Zaun are never going to unite again due to rifts in their culture and society already being lightyears apart, and the only time they'll ever get to experience this unification is during Seraphine's performances. This is exactly what Seraphine wants, as she manifests this same longing and desire for another dopamine inducing performance in her audience.  When the entirety of Piltover and Zaun is under her influence, Seraphine can finally unify the voices of everyone she can hear and achieve ultimate inner peace through her song. Hextech amplified speakers in the streets will blare her songs day and night. Commuters sing with their soul and minds with Seraphine as they step onto the subway to go to work. Freedom of thought is replaced with never-ending unity and peace of mind. Without the conflicted desires and opinions of people, everyone can be happy! Especially Seraphine, who sits at the highest tower in the city, leaning back into her chair and closing her eyes to relish the never ending soul song of her audience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hidden Resistance and Ruthless Silencing**

Now that we know Seraphine's true motives in uniting Piltover and Zaun, there's one more thing that doesn't quite line up. Why can Seraphine deal damage with her abilities in game and also shield allies with literally nothing but sound? Well the answer is pretty obvious now. Seraphine expected resistance to her ultimate goal, and of course she would have precautions to prevent people from stopping her. Through experimentation and practice, Seraphine uses her stage's amplified sound to further develop her powers so that she can even use sound to inflict physical damage on people or create magical sound waves capable of mitigating impact. Using these abilities, Seraphine listens closely to her audience and roots out traitors and haters, silences them forever with carefully aimed downbeat at the finishing flourish of her song. After all, nobody sees or hears a body drop if it's accompanied by a sick bass drop. Three of Seraphine's abilities and her passive also have some kind of ally interaction, which really puts it out there that cooperation is the best chance you're gonna get to survive. Her shield and heal require allies to be near her to receive the bonuses, hinting at her desire for her audience's dependence towards her songs. Seraphine's passive gathers notes that reflect the support she gathers for each performance. Her ultimate extends off allies and enemies, convincing both parties that it's best if they stay in line. Her Q and E are her main tools for dealing with pesky obstacles on her quest for unity and peace. After dealing with a threat, the sound waves dissipate with not trace of a murder even happening, allowing Seraphine to continue her performances unimpeded after dealing with the bodies.

&amp;#x200B;

And there you have it. Seraphine's intentions seem good at surface level, but dig a little deeper and the sinister truth always unveils itself. If her story seemed a little innocent and out of place compared to other champions, this is the reason why. A paper thin facade, only enough to hide the truth.",leagueoflegends

The brief translation to the video is that the current build version of steraks does not grant extra heals for the stacks you have on steraks, and the next patch will actually grant extra heal which means it's actually receiving a buff",leagueoflegends
t3_m34x41,"100T and roaming mid laners, learn Nocturne","After becoming a 100T fan during lockins with their dive bot style, I'm sad to see them fall from grace and hearing a lot of discussion about 100T losing their identity by conforming to the meta. While I have no idea what's going on scrims, a pick like Nocturne is easy enough to practice and learn to keep in your back pocket as a counter to control mages that leans into 100T's strengths. 

Sure you might fail hard and lose a game by picking Nocturne mid, but you'll gain so much more attention than just another Azir, Orianna, or Syndra game.

t3_m3hopk,Instruction - How to balance items properly.,"Hi.  My name is Psota, and I do play this lovely game since its very beginning in 2009.   
I'd like to share my observations and idea how to fix frutrating problems with items in this season.   
Big majority of players is more and more frustrated over new items which are supertuned.   
The change of items was a revolution. But not every revolution is a good process.   
This revolution wasnt.  


So what we need? What can be done?  
We need devolution.   
The perfect would be to revert changes to items.   


But...  
To make it super balanced my idea is:  
Make items superduper simple.  
What I mean is :  
An example. Item like Immortal Shieldbow  
55ad, 20as, 20cryt, 12lifesteal  
This item is universal. It has everything almost every AD characters needs.  


So lets make items simple.  
Make items which gives only AD.  
Or only Crit chance  
or only Lifesteal.  
Make the builds not universal but rather oriented on one stat.   


Champions goin into crit would have high crit chance, but dmg woudnt be so impressive.   
Champions goin into lifesteal would have high sustain, but will deal not so impressive dmg.  
Champions goin into pure AD would have big dmg, but no crits and no lifesteal.  
Players would need to balance their builds. Make it most optimal.",leagueoflegends

t3_m38qb9,Odd dmg numbers,"Ok so I just ran in to the strangest thing ever, during the entire game I had a feeling I wasn't dealing enough damage, so I went in to spectate mode

to just look at the numbers, can someone explain to me why an aa did 56 dmg on Vi with 1 armour more (36) = 26% ad reduction and than my aa on quinn only did 34 dmg when she only have (34) armour 25% ad reducation????

I was thinking about runes, but noone is running anything that would reduce the damage. If anything I would do more damage on quinn because I was running Cut Down for some reason and Quinn have more hp than Vi.

This was bothering me all game because I didn't watch every encounter but it happend more than 3 times, is there cheat that can do this? or

I find this a kind of a big deal

Cara eu sinto MUITAS saudades desse modo, e eu penso que as pessoas podem começar a pedir para que a Riot considera alguma forma de nos dar uma oportunidade para jogar esse modo, nem que seja criando um outro jogo só com esse modo; - ;, sei que parece loucura, mas pense em uma espécie de PBE que a gente vai jogar todos os modos já lançados?

Especially Sunfire Aegis because its practically the same price. 

However what It is beyond me is that AP Assassin mythics such as night harvester or a mage mythic such as everfrost give more HP than Trinity force and stridebreaker. 

At the very least I can see It on stridebreaker because It gives mobility to already tanky folks so It is okay, but triforce? It makes no sense... Fizz, ekko, nidalee or evelynn, all of them build more HP any triforce user? It makes absolutely no sense.",leagueoflegends
